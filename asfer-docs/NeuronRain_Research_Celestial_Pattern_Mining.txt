(*) ./asfer - C++ binary and doClustering=true in asfer.conf - clusters the string encoded celestial configurations by KMeans and kNN clustering algorithms

(*) python AsferClassifierPreproc.py - #autogenerated words.txt and words-frequency.txt needed for NaiveBayesClassifier

(*) geonames.py - #Geolocation Service JSON Request and Response for timezone Offset #Copyright - https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/2288222/download# #Simplified and modified for AstroInfer

(*) python asfer_dataset_segregator.py - #Partitions the parsed datasets which contain date-time-long-lat data based on classifier output grepped #by the invoker shell script - asfer_dataset_segregator.sh -  and writes the names of parsed dataset files into
#text files with names of regular expression "EventClassDataSet_<class>.txt"

(*) python MaitreyaToEncHoroClassified.py - #Reads the segregated parsed dataset files generated by asfer_dataset_aggregator.sh and invokes maitreya_textclient #for all date-time-long-lat data within all parsed datasets for a particular event class - "EventClassDataset_<class>.txt"
#and also creates autogenerated asfer.enchoros.<class>.zodiacal and asfer.enchoros.<class>.ascrelative encoded files

(*) python SequenceMining,py -  #This class Implements Sequence Mining for encoded strings - at present Apriori GSP algorithm has been #implemented - uses Downward Closure - superset is frequent only if subset is frequent #SourceForge version is specialized for Mining Astronomical Datasets - read from files with .enchoros suffix.  #It predicts pattern in swiss ephermeris encoded astronomical datasets corresponding to weather phenomena.  #GitHub version is generic to all string patterns.
