Coding Conventions and Best Practices followed in NeuronRain Architecture and Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no strict standard conventions or practices followed in NeuronRain commits but following are
some guiding principles:
1.NeuronRain repositories are spread across SourceForge(https://sourceforge.net/u/userid-769929/),GitHub(https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/) and GitLab(https://gitlab.com/shrinivaasanka/) - though they do not differ much at present, NeuronRain SourceForge focuses on Astronomical Datasets, NeuronRain GitHub is for Generic Datasets and Clouds and NeuronRain GitLab is intended for Drone Development. Every source file has copyleft header and attributions.
2.Presently there are no Continuous Integration/Unit testing framework. But every code change is tested manually 
and logs are captured suffixing timestamps in separate testlogs/ folder within C/C++/Java/Python source directories.
3.Development model followed is somewhat similar to Agile (but only a Single person team - K.Srinivasan - https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ - Deleted and Mirrored at https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs/tree/master/kuja27_website_mirrored) and small incremental changes are frequent compared to rare big feature additions/changes especially in Python/MachineLearning code. 
4.Code documentation - comments are profusely littered wherever necessary. NeuronRain FAQ simulates an enduser and asks questions on h(is/er) behalf and answers them.
5.Architectural choices are more important than implementation - no complicated overengineering - Occam's Razor. 
6.VIRGO32 and VIRGO64 linux kernel base mainline PPA versions are not frequently updated having reached minimum stability.
7.Benchmarks on Single/Multicore/Clusters are committed for salient Cloud implemented features (Factorization, Intrinsic Merit/Fitness, VIRGO system calls-drivers etc.,)
8.Code Reviews are Self-Reviews only based on QE/QA.
9.To err is human - erroneous commits are corrected as and when found. Bug Tracking is minimal.(e.g AsFer GitHub issues page - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). 
10.NeuronRain architecure and development has two worlds - userspace(AsFer) cloud/machine learning and kernelspace(VIRGO/KingCobra/USBmd) cloud/Embedded/IoT/Drones/Robotics - connected by kernel_analytics.conf and live reading of remote sockets for analytics variables from kernel_analytics module. AsFer has more activity compared to others.
11.No strict deadlines/releases but repositories are source-released periodically.
12.Bug Reports/Pull Requests are encouraged but resolution depends on feasibility and time availability.
13.Each NeuronRain repository has a design document updated periodically for commits and related technical notes.Though "git log" is sufficient, design document delves into theoretical aspects of the implementation which are related to publications and draft publications of the author. Commits for multiple dates are sometimes batched and dates of commits might be out of sync with dates of code commentaries in design documents. NeuronRain design documents have unified numbering for theory content because of strongly connected conceptual graph aligned to the 32-bit and 64-bit codebases - AstroInfer(Machine Learning), USBmd(Software Analytics and Program Analyzer), VIRGO(IoT,Scheduler/Kernel Analytics and Program Analyzer), KingCobra(Kernelspace messaging and Algorithmic economics), GRAFIT(course materials overlap theory of NeuronRain), Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs(NeuronRain FAQ), Acadpdrafts(publications and drafts for implementations in NeuronRain).
14.In essence any good software relies on the basic thumbrule: concept feature --- design/algorithm for feature --- choice of software for implementation of the algorithm --- how much value this new feature adds to existing implementation .
15.Any software is the result of immense human effort. NeuronRain is more of an academic research product (more of alpha or beta version in state of flux) which has not been tested on a Production-grade cloud/Drones and largescale commercial deployments if any are cautioned against per FAQ,Licensing and Documentation URLs in 17 and 18 - especially VIRGO linux kernel system calls and drivers are sensitive to hardware and architectural idiosyncracies. Dependency OSS licenses are strictly respected and periodically updated in Requirements.txt. 
16.Copyrights for Images, Audios, Videos, Manual or Spider Crawled Websites, News articles and Social Network Profiles for testing purposes have been attributed to the respective source - Most of them are related to the author excluding music clips.
