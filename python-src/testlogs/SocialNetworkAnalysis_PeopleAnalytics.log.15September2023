Presently the sizeij (cell size) values are presumptive and can be substituted from a raster GeoTIFF file.\n1448.4 Earlier formula (2) is probably a first ever official regression for urban area delineation independent of machine learning-cellular automata models (1226.13),Polya Urn urban growth models and NightTimeLights radiance and it replaces urban area size by its population as proxy.\n1448.5 Computation of FUA value for above data is at python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.28August2023 and can be normalized to a boolean value by adjustment of regression weights (by predefined minimum and maximum values for FUAij):\n   FUAij (can be converted to a boolean value for whether periurban cell i belongs to urban area j): 2585539060011.65\n1448.6 Population is chosen as a predictor of urban area size as described in the model (2) of the paper - \"...... we compare three different proxies for urban centre size: area, population and nightlight.....\" while model (1) (section 1423.8) relied on number of cars which are proportional to nightlights. Distance in above model is actually proportional to the travel time from cell i to urban center j by public or private transport (or ease of mobility) - though it is still debatable on which travel time (fastest or slowest mode) has to be chosen.\n1448.7 Travel time to a periurban cell and Isochrone ego graphs in general could be estimated from Google Maps Live Traffic ViteJS implementation in NeuronRain Grafit (Drive Time Radius Isochrones are periodic snapshots of live traffic) - Section 1387 - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/tree/master/course_material/Programming/GUI/code/livetraffic . Emphasis on size of urban center as one of the FUA criteria is a rephrasal of preferential attachment (Big cities tend to get Bigger) - quoted excerpts from the paper - \"...... Travel time from each cell to the urban centre is the most powerful predictor of the probability of belonging to a FUA, followed by the size of the urban centre .....\"",

Presently the sizeij (cell size) values are presumptive and can be substituted from a raster GeoTIFF file.\n1448.4 Earlier formula (2) is probably a first ever official regression for urban area delineation independent of machine learning-cellular automata models (1226.13),Polya Urn urban growth models and NightTimeLights radiance and it replaces urban area size by its population as proxy.\n1448.5 Computation of FUA value for above data is at python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.28August2023 and can be normalized to a boolean value by adjustment of regression weights (by predefined minimum and maximum values for FUAij):\n   FUAij (can be converted to a boolean value for whether periurban cell i belongs to urban area j): 2585539060011.65\n1448.6 Population is chosen as a predictor of urban area size as described in the model (2) of the paper - \"...... we compare three different proxies for urban centre size: area, population and nightlight.....\" while model (1) (section 1423.8) relied on number of cars which are proportional to nightlights. Distance in above model is actually proportional to the travel time from cell i to urban center j by public or private transport (or ease of mobility) - though it is still debatable on which travel time (fastest or slowest mode) has to be chosen.\n1448.7 Travel time to a periurban cell and Isochrone ego graphs in general could be estimated from Google Maps Live Traffic ViteJS implementation in NeuronRain Grafit (Drive Time Radius Isochrones are periodic snapshots of live traffic) - Section 1387 - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/tree/master/course_material/Programming/GUI/code/livetraffic . Emphasis on size of urban center as one of the FUA criteria is a rephrasal of preferential attachment (Big cities tend to get Bigger) - quoted excerpts from the paper - \"......

Presently the sizeij (cell size) values are presumptive and can be substituted from a raster GeoTIFF file.\n1448.4 Earlier formula (2) is probably a first ever official regression for urban area delineation independent of machine learning-cellular automata models (1226.13),Polya Urn urban growth models and NightTimeLights radiance and it replaces urban area size by its population as proxy.\n1448.5 Computation of FUA value for above data is at python-src/image_pattern_mining/ImageNet/testlogs/GISUrbanSprawlAnalytics.log.28August2023 and can be normalized to a boolean value by adjustment of regression weights (by predefined minimum and maximum values for FUAij):\n   FUAij (can be converted to a boolean value for whether periurban cell i belongs to urban area j): 2585539060011.65\n1448.6 Population is chosen as a predictor of urban area size as described in the model (2) of the paper - \"...... we compare three different proxies for urban centre size: area, population and nightlight.....\" while model (1) (section 1423.8) relied on number of cars which are proportional to nightlights. Distance in above model is actually proportional to the travel time from cell i to urban center j by public or private transport (or ease of mobility) - though it is still debatable on which travel time (fastest or slowest mode) has to be chosen.\n1448.7 Travel time to a periurban cell and Isochrone ego graphs in general could be estimated from Google Maps Live Traffic ViteJS implementation in NeuronRain Grafit (Drive Time Radius Isochrones are periodic snapshots of live traffic) - Section 1387 - https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/tree/master/course_material/Programming/GUI/code/livetraffic . Emphasis on size of urban center as one of the FUA criteria is a rephrasal of preferential attachment (Big cities tend to get Bigger) - quoted excerpts from the paper - \"...... Travel time from each cell to the urban centre is the most powerful predictor of the probability of belonging to a FUA, followed by the size of the urban centre .....\"",

Percentage similarities are printed in both directions of Graph matching (G1 -> G2 and G2 -> G1). Callgraphs are matched pairwise and only similar executables are fully isomorphic and subgraph isomorphic while dissimilar executables are not. Matching has been restricted to few pairs only as Graph isomorphism is computationally intensive and its lowerbound complexity is not yet proved.\n1192.4 Graph Isomorphisms are tools to find similarity of codebases belonging to different repositories which is a pointer to frequently common algorithms and design patterns across implementations. Graph Isomorphism Detectors are used in anti-plagiarism tools and analyzing malicious code invocations (if Callgraphs-ControlFlowGraphs in two computers running similar executable are not isomorphic something could be brewing - one of them could be infected).\n1192.5 Previous code change implements an item specified in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs/blob/master/kuja27_website_mirrored/site/kuja27/PhDThesisProposal.pdf on isomorphism of Program Control Flow Graphs (SATURN-FTrace-Valgrind-Callgrind-KCacheGrind) and Slice Dependency Graphs.\n1192.6 FTrace logs and DOT files of kernelspace callgraphs for \"find\" and \"pwd\" executables created by asfer_ftrace.sh and parsed to DOT by:\n        ftrace_callgraph_dot(\"ftrace.pwd.log\")\n        ftrace_callgraph_dot(\"ftrace.find.log\")\nhave been added to repositories:\n        find.ftrace_callgraph.dot\n        ftrace.find.log\n        ftrace.pwd.log\n        pwd.ftrace_callgraph.dot\n1192.7 Isomorphism iterations and ISMGAS symmetry have been made configurable arguments and set to default 25 and False respectively.

Percentage similarities are printed in both directions of Graph matching (G1 -> G2 and G2 -> G1). Callgraphs are matched pairwise and only similar executables are fully isomorphic and subgraph isomorphic while dissimilar executables are not. Matching has been restricted to few pairs only as Graph isomorphism is computationally intensive and its lowerbound complexity is not yet proved.\n1192.4 Graph Isomorphisms are tools to find similarity of codebases belonging to different repositories which is a pointer to frequently common algorithms and design patterns across implementations. Graph Isomorphism Detectors are used in anti-plagiarism tools and analyzing malicious code invocations (if Callgraphs-ControlFlowGraphs in two computers running similar executable are not isomorphic something could be brewing - one of them could be infected).\n1192.5 Previous code change implements an item specified in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs/blob/master/kuja27_website_mirrored/site/kuja27/PhDThesisProposal.pdf on isomorphism of Program Control Flow Graphs (SATURN-FTrace-Valgrind-Callgrind-KCacheGrind) and Slice Dependency Graphs.\n1192.6 FTrace logs and DOT files of kernelspace callgraphs for \"find\" and \"pwd\" executables created by asfer_ftrace.sh and parsed to DOT by:\n        ftrace_callgraph_dot(\"ftrace.pwd.log\")\n        ftrace_callgraph_dot(\"ftrace.find.log\")\nhave been added to repositories:\n        find.ftrace_callgraph.dot\n        ftrace.find.log\n        ftrace.pwd.log\n        pwd.ftrace_callgraph.dot\n1192.7 Isomorphism iterations and ISMGAS symmetry have been made configurable arguments and set to default 25 and False respectively. CyclomaticComplexitySparkMapReducer.py has been upgraded to Python 3.7.5 + Spark 3.0.1 by autopep8 and 2to3 utilities.

(THEORY and FEATURE) People Analytics - Set Partition Analytics based Drone Electronic Voting Machine - updated - 9 October 2019 - related to 713\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.py has been changed to update electronic_voting_machine() function - New semaphore mutual exclusion synchronized primitive block (BoundedSemaphore) has been added to guard the voting critical section. Maximum value of semaphore is set to 1 voter.\n2.Voting code has been updated to check if voter has already voted by Voted list and skip voting if yes. Voter id(s) are appended to Voted array after voting within synchronized block.\n3.Additional encryption has been introduced by invoking SHA256 Passlib encrypt on the ripemd160 publicuniqueid hex hash digest and append the encrypted voter id to EVM bucket.\n4.This EVM assumes the function electronic_voting_machine() is invoked from a Drone python code which should have already navigated to the voter address and done the user/password authentication by smartcard.\n5.Single Signon username/password authentication has already been implemented in NeuronRain GUI - python-src/webserver_rest_ui/NeuronRain_REST_WebServer.py - by passlib OAuth having MongoDB and Redis credential storage - which might as well be used as alternative caller for this EVM.\n6.logs for preventing repetitive voting and SHA256 buckets are at testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.EVM.log.9October2019\n7.This Set Partition EVM is also a Dynamic Graph Partition (Similar Worst Case Execution Time - Survival Index - Dynamic Graph Partition OS Scheduler is described in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt - Hashing Dynamic Sets) because voting is dynamic and voters related among themselves might vote for different candidates which creates edges of dynamic people partition graph (voter vertices related by edges are partitioned into candidate buckets)\n8.As mentioned in previous section, Left Inverse of Voter Bucket Objects is the Candidate voted for connecting peer voters by an equivalence relation.",

Maximum value of semaphore is set to 1 voter.\n2.Voting code has been updated to check if voter has already voted by Voted list and skip voting if yes. Voter id(s) are appended to Voted array after voting within synchronized block.\n3.Additional encryption has been introduced by invoking SHA256 Passlib encrypt on the ripemd160 publicuniqueid hex hash digest and append the encrypted voter id to EVM bucket.\n4.This EVM assumes the function electronic_voting_machine() is invoked from a Drone python code which should have already navigated to the voter address and done the user/password authentication by smartcard.\n5.Single Signon username/password authentication has already been implemented in NeuronRain GUI - python-src/webserver_rest_ui/NeuronRain_REST_WebServer.py - by passlib OAuth having MongoDB and Redis credential storage - which might as well be used as alternative caller for this EVM.\n6.logs for preventing repetitive voting and SHA256 buckets are at testlogs/Streaming_SetPartitionAnalytics.EVM.log.9October2019\n7.This Set Partition EVM is also a Dynamic Graph Partition (Similar Worst Case Execution Time - Survival Index - Dynamic Graph Partition OS Scheduler is described in https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Grafit/blob/master/course_material/NeuronRain/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning/AdvancedComputerScienceAndMachineLearning.txt - Hashing Dynamic Sets) because voting is dynamic and voters related among themselves might vote for different candidates which creates edges of dynamic people partition graph (voter vertices related by edges are partitioned into candidate buckets)\n8.As mentioned in previous section, Left Inverse of Voter Bucket Objects is the Candidate voted for connecting peer voters by an equivalence relation.",

In this commit, tile interval storage is obviated and each foreach() invokes a function which computes non-persisted tile interval locally and does binary search to print factors. SparkContext.parallelize() takes xrange() as argument. Python xrange() is an optimized implementation of list and returns XRange object.XRange object does not store all the elements in memory and is more like an iterator.

(THEORY and FEATURE-DONE) Computational Geometric Factorization Update - Local Tile Computation and necessity for storage removed -\n10 January 2018 - 30-bit integer dual core single node Spark Cluster benchmark - related to 495\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs mentioned in previous section, reading tiles from storage in SparkContext.parallelize() is a serious bottleneck. In this commit, tile interval storage is obviated and each foreach() invokes a function which computes non-persisted tile interval locally and does binary search to print factors. SparkContext.parallelize() takes xrange() as argument. Python xrange() is an optimized implementation of list and returns XRange object.XRange object does not store all the elements in memory and is more like an iterator. A thirty bit integer has been factored and numbers are below:\n---------------------------\nFactorization of 921234437:\n---------------------------\n18/01/10 17:56:56 INFO Utils: /home/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_OpenSource/GitHub/asfer-github-code/python-src/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py has been previously copied to /tmp/spark-9fba8482-8ca1-4022-9bcc-1c285a8e1f58/userFiles-3e4bf574-9b1a-44c5-8b96-3873e96dc6c3/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound_TileSearch_Optimized.py\nFactor is =  1\nFactor is =  17\nFactor is =  19\nFactor is =  59\nFactor is =  323\nFactor is =  1003\nFactor is =  1121\nFactor is =  19057\nFactor is =  48341\nFactor is =  821797\nFactor is =  918479\nFactor is =  2852119\nFactor is =  15614143\nFactor is =  48486023\nFactor is =  54190261\n18/01/10 18:08:51 INFO PythonRunner: Times: total = 714516, boot = 649, init = 23, finish = 713844\n\nSpark Duration: 18:08:51 - 17:56:56 = 535seconds\n\nSpark-Python has RPC and serialization latencies and following numbers could be better if implemented in a different frameworks like Slurm and on a Gigabit ENA cloud.

==================================
DESIGN NOTES, THEORETICAL INTERLUDES(might have errors), TODO AND NICE TO HAVE FEATURES (list is quite dynamic and might be rewritten depending on feasibility - long-term design goals with no deadline)
(FEATURE - DONE-MDL,Entropy,Edit Distance,Compressed Sensing) 1. Test with Massive Data Sets of encoded strings for pattern mining. Algorithms for Approximate Kolmogorov Complexity or Minimum Description Length (MDL), Shannon Entropy, Levenshtein Edit Distance have been implemented in Python and C++. Compressed Sensing (used in Image and Signal Processing) which "sense" from "compressed" large data - This involves computing a matrix product AX=B where X is an image or bitmap and A is a chosen matrix which together give a sketch B. Sketch of an image bitmap has been implemented.
(FEATURE - THEORY-POC Implementation-DONE) 2. An experimental text compression algorithm that deletes vowels and stores only consonants as far as meaning is not altered. For example "follow" could be stored as "fllw". Since on an average every third letter in an english word is a vowel, approximate compression is 33%. Message is reconstructed using most probable meaningful word for "fllw" (For example "follow" could be more probable than "fellow" or vice versa). This is similar to Texting in phones and to some extent encoding in Match Rating (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_rating_approach). One more example could be "Decision" which can be compressed as "Dcsn". An interesting phonetic aspect of this is that "Decision" is spelt as "Dee-C-shan", or each vowel following a consonant is subsumed or coalesced into the preceding consonant while spelling. Thus "Dcsn" gives 50% compression ratio. PyEnchant python package SpellChecker has suggest() function that returns a tuple of closely related words to a compressed (or "misspelt") word. Conventional WSD algorithms might have to be used on this tuple to get the maximum match. Initial testing reveals that the accuracy with spellcheckers is less and this problem requires a non-trivial algorithm which might require error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon and Berelekamp-Massey assuming the english text as a finite field of alphabets as elements. Predominantly used dictionary-based Lesk's disambiguation Algorithm can find the intersection between "follow" and the rest of the context and "fellow" and rest of the context and choose the word with maximum intersection with context - this is quite commonsensical too. But the drawback of this disambiguation is that keywords are disambiguated well while other connectives (is, are, thus,  this, who, why etc.,) in the sentences are not. Another limitation of applying WSD while decompressing is lack of meaningful context words at runtime - only compressed words are available and they cannot be used as disambiguating context creating a circular dependency - disambiguation requires decompression and decompression needs disambiguation. For computing maximum likelihood, most probable vowel between 2 consonants can be zeroed in on by a 26*26 table of consonant ordered pairs and having vowels between them as probability distribution priors. This is feasible only if priors are available. For example th-t has (h,t) as consonant pairs and a is most probable vowel than e,i,o and u and th-t is disambiguated as "that". The vowels missing in compressed text can be represented by a single extra bit. This is an alternative to PyEnchant spellcheck suggest() function. This can be Hidden Markov Model also - with missing vowels as hidden states to measure and compressed letters as observations. This requires forward-backward probabilities computation or Viterbi path which gives most likely word for a compressed word. For "th-t" the Markov Model looks like:
3. (FEATURE - THEORY - Pairwise LCS implementation DONE) KMeans, KNN and other clustering and classification algorithms implemented thus far, group similar encoded strings for astronomical (or any other) data. Clustered strings can further be mined for patterns with ordering by applying a Longest Common Substring algorithm within each cluster. This gives a fine grained pattern hidden in the encoded input strings. These longest common substrings can then be translated to a rule similar to class association rule (Frequent item set and GSP algorithms are quite expensive and do not fit well for mining patterns in strings).
4. (FEATURE - DONE) Implementation of String Distance measure using different distance measures (python-src/StringMatch.py) for comparing Encoded Strings in addition to pairwise and Multiple Sequence Alignment.
5. (FEATURE - DONE) Construct a Hidden Markov Model with State transitions and Observations(events). If the number of states are exponential then this will be infeasible. A HMM has been implemented for text decompression with vowel-removed strings. Also a HMM has been implemented for Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Conditional Random Fields.
6. (FEATURE - DONE - continuation of point 3) Correlate with Rules from Classics (BPHS, BJ etc.,) with the mined datasets for particular class of events (Special Case of Mundane Predictive Model is described in items 47 to 51 and basic framework is already implemented). The Longest Common Substring implementation already mines for most common pattern with in a clustered or classified dataset of encoded strings which suffices for astronomical datasets. Script for parsing the clustered data from classifiers and decoding the longest common pattern have been added.
7. (FEATURE - DONE) Integrate Classifiers in above String Pattern mining (classify strings and then mine).
8. (FEATURE - DONE) At present fundamental algorithms like - Perceptrons with Gradient Descent, Linear and Logistic Regression, Hidden Markov Model for Text Decompression, KMeans Clustering, Naive Bayesian, Decision Tree, SVM (uses thirdparty OSS) and kNN Classifiers, String Alignment and Distance based algorithms, Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Match Algorithm, Sequence Mining, Deep Learning(Convolution and Backpropagation), Social Network Analysis, Sentiment Analysis - have been implemented specialized for the encoded strings astronomical datasets.
9. (FEATURE - DONE) InterviewAlgorithm code in https://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/146/tree/python-src/InterviewAlgorithm/InterviewAlgorithmWithIntrinisicMerit.py and Classification based on indegrees of wordnet subgraph node in action item 6 above (as mentioned in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 , https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/TAC2010papersubmission.pdf?attredirects=0 and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf).

Test C++ code written in 2006 for computing Majority voting error probability is at: http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/cpp-src/miscellaneous/pgood.cpp and python script written in 2010 is at: http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/python-src/pgood.py. 
15. (FEATURE - DONE-Minimum Implementation using NetworkX algorithms) Add Graph Search (for example subgraph isomorphism, frequent subgraph mining etc.,) for "inferring" a graph from dataset with edges as relations and nodes as entities(astronomical or otherwise).Reference survey of FSM algorithms: http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/PostScriptFiles/ker-jct-6-May-11.pdf. The context of "Graph Search" includes deducing relationships hidden in a text data by use of WordNet(construction of wordnet subgraph by Definition Graph Recursive Gloss Overlap etc.,), mining graph patterns in Social Networks etc., At present a WordNet Graph Search and Visualizer python script that renders the definition graph and computes core numbers for unsupervised classification (subgraph of WordNet projected to a text data) has been added to repository.
16. (FEATURE - DONE) Use of already implemented Bayesian and Decision Tree Classifiers on astronomical data set for prediction (this would complement the use of classifiers for string mining) - autogen_classifier_dataset/ directory contains Automated Classified Dataset and Encoded Horoscopes Generation code.
17. (FEATURE - DONE) Added Support for datasets other than USGS EQ dataset(parseUSGSdata.py). NOAA HURDAT2 dataset has been parsed and encoded pygen horoscope string dataset has been autogenerated by parseNOAA_HURDAT2_data.py
18. (FEATURE - Minimum Functionality DONE-TwitterFollowersGraphRendering, Centrality) (Astro)PsychoSocialAnalysis  - Social Network Graph Analysis and Sentiment Analysis of Social Media and drawing inferences on Psychology and Human Opinion Mining in broader sense - for example, how a social network forms, how opinions, edges and vertices appear over time , Rich-get-Richer in Random Network Erdos-Renyi Model - which by majority opinion seems to be a bad model choice for Social Networking (Do people flock to popular social groups?), Bonacich Power Centrality (a social prestige measure predating PageRank) etc.,. Related to point 15.
19. (FEATURE - DONE-PAC Learnt Boolean Conjunction) Implement prototypical PAC learning of Boolean Functions from dataset. Complement Boolean Function construction described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4102 is in a way an example of PAC learnt Boolean Function - it is rather C Learnt (Correct Learning) because there is no probability or approximation. Complement Boolean Function can be PAC learnt (with upperbounded error) as follows:
20. (FEATURE - DONE) Integrate AstroInfer to VIRGO-KingCobra-USBmd Platform which makes it an Approximately Intelligent Cloud Operating System Framework - a Cloud OS that "learns" ,"decides" from datasets and "drives" using AstroInfer code. AsFer+USBmd+VIRGO+KingCobra integrated cloud platform with machine learning features together have been christened as "Krishna iResearch Intelligent Cloud Platform" or "NeuronRain". It has to be mentioned here that NeuronRain cloud differs from traditional cloud in following ways:
21. (FEATURE - DONE-Minimum Implementation) Unsupervised Named Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech tagging using Conditional Random Fields(CRF) and Viterbi path computation in CRF. Bayesian Network and Belief propagation might be implemented if necessary - as they are graphical models where graph edges are labelled with conditional probabilities and belief potentials respectively and can be part of other larger modules. 
22. (FEATURE - DONE-Minimum Implementation) Period Three theorem (www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/LiYorke.pdf) which is one of the earliest results in Chaotic NonLinear Systems, implies any data that has a periodicity of 3 can have larger periods. Fractals, Mandelbrot-Julia Sets have modelled natural phenomena. Thus finding if a data has periodicity or Chaos and if it has sensitive dependence on initial conditions (for example logistic equations similar to x(n+1) = kx(n)(1-x(n))) is a way to mine numerical data. Computation of Hausdorff-Besicovitch Dimension can be implemented to get Fractal Dimension of an uncountable set (this has to be visualized as a fractal curve than set of points). In addition to these, an Implementation of Chaotic PRG algorithms as described in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/ChaoticPRG.pdf?attredirects=0 and https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/Analysis%20of%20a%20Randomized%20Space%20Filling%20Algorithm%20and%20its%20Linear%20Program%20Formulation.pdf?attredirects=0 can be done.
23. (FEATURE - DONE) Entropy of numerical data - Sum of -Pr(x)LogPr(x) for all possible outcome probabilities for a random variable. This is already computed in Decision Tree Classifier as impurity measure of a dataset. Also a python Entropy implementation for texts has been added to repository - computes weighted average of number of bits required to minimum-describe the text.
25. (FEATURE - DONE) Approximating with some probability distribution - Gaussian, Binomial etc., that model the probability of occurence of a datapoint in the set. Kullback-Leibler Divergence python implementation which computes distance in terms of amount of bits between two probability distribution has been added to python-src/. Minimum of the distance for different standard distributions with a dataset is the closest distribution approximation for the dataset.
(FEATURE - DONE) 26. Streaming algorithms - Finding Frequency moments, Heavy Hitters(most prominent items), Distinct Elements etc., in the numerical dataset. Usually numerical data occur in streams making these best choice for mining numerical data. 
(FEATURE - DONE) 26.1 Implementation of LogLog and HyperLogLog Counter(cardinality - distinct elements in streamed multiset), CountMinSketch-CountMeanMinSketch (Frequencies and heavy hitters) and Bloom Filters(membership)
(FEATURE - DONE) 26.2 Parser and non-text file Storage framework for Realtime Streaming Data - Hive, HBase, Cassandra, Spark and Pig Scripts and Clients for Storage Backends have been implemented. The Storage is abstracted by a generator - architecture diagram at: http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/asfer-docs/BigDataStorageAbstractionInAsFer.jpg
(FEATURE - DONE) 26.3 Python scripts for Stock Quotes Data and Twitter tweets stream search data for a query.
27. (FEATURE - DONE) Usual Probabilistic Measures of Mean, Median, Curve fitting on the numeric data. Python+RPy2+R implementation wrapper has been added to repository (python-src/Norms_and_Basic_Statistics.py)
28. (FEATURE - DONE - using python, R+rpy2) Application of Discrete Fourier Transform(using R), LOESS(using R), Linear Polynomial Approximate Interpolation(using R), Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent
29. (FEATURE - DONE) Least Squares Method on datapoints y(i)s for some x(i)s such that f(x)~y needs to be found. Computation of L0, L1 and L2 norms. Python+RPy2+R implementation wrapper has been added to repository (python-src/Norms_and_Basic_Statistics.py)
(FEATURE - DONE)30. K-Means and kNN Clustering(if necessary and some training data is available) - unsupervised and supervised clustering based on coordinates of the numerical dataset
31. (FEATURE - DONE) Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization - Author has been working on a factorization algorithm with elementary proof based on discretization of a hyperbola since 2000 and there seems to be some headway recently in 2013. To confirm the polylog correctness, a minimal implementation of Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization (and could be even less than polylog due to a weird upperbound obtained using stirling formula) has been added to AstroInfer repository at: http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/HEAD/tree/cpp-src/miscellaneous/DiscreteHyperbolicFactorizationUpperbound.cpp with factors output logs.
32. (FEATURE - DONE) Multiple versions of Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization algorithms have been uploaded as drafts in https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27:
34. (FEATURE - DONE) An updated draft version of PRAM NC algorithm for Discrete Hyperbolic Factorization has been uploaded - with a new section for Parallel RAM to NC reduction, disambiguation on input size (N and not logN is the input size for ANSV algorithm and yet is in NC - in NC2 to be exact - (logN)^2 time and polynomial in N PRAM processors - NC circuit depth translates to PRAM time and NC circuit size to number of PRAMs):
36.1. (FEATURE - DONE-WordNet Visualizer implementation for point 15) The classification using Interview Algorithm Definition Graph (obtained from Recursive Gloss Overlap algorithm described in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 , https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/TAC2010papersubmission.pdf?attredirects=0 and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf ) wordnet node indegrees can classify a same document in multiple classes without any training set (unsupervised). Thus same document will be in multiple classes. This can be visualized as one stack per class and documents in same class are pushed into a stack corresponding to each class. When a same document is across multiple classes, a document can be visualized as a "hyperedge" of a hypergraph that transcends multiple class nodes. Here each class node in this non-planar graph (or multi-planar graph) is a stack.
37.(FEATURE - PoC WordNet Visualizer Closure DONE) Above multiplanar hypergraph is quite related as a theoretical construct to a Pushdown Automata for Context Free Grammar. Also the Definition Graph Construction using Recursive Gloss Overlap is a Context-Sensitive counterpart of Parse Trees obtained for Context Free Grammar, but ignoring Parts-Of-Speech Tagging and relying only on the relation between words or concepts within each sentence of the document which is mapped to a multipartite or general graph. Infact this Definition Graph and Concept Hypergraph constructed above from indegrees quite resemble a Functional Programming Paradigm where each relationship edge is a Functional Program subroutine and the vertices are the parameters to it. Thus a hyperedge could be visualized as Composition Operator of Functional Programs including FP routines for Parts-of-Speech if necessary [WordNet or above Concept Hypergraph can be strengthened with FPs like LISP, Haskell etc.,]. RecursiveNeuralNetworks(MV-RNN and RNTN) have a notion of compositionality quite similar to Functional Programming in FPs (Reference: http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf ) but for tree structures. Applying the compositionality for Concept Hypergraphs constructed above using FPs is a possible research direction.
- (FEATURE - DONE) DecisionTree, NaiveBayes and SVM classifiers and horoscope encoders are already in the AstroInfer codebase. 
- (FEATURE - DONE) Encode the dataset which might be USGS or NOAA(Science on a Sphere) datasets or anyother dataset available after getting text horos for these using Maitreya's Dreams textclient (AstroInfer version)
- (FEATURE - DONE) Above gives encoded horoscope strings for all classes of mundane events in both Zodiacal and AscendantRelative formats (autogenerated by Python scripts in python-src/)
- (FEATURE - DONE) Above set is a mix of encoded strings for all events which can be classified using one of the classifiers above.
- (FEATURE - DONE) For each class the set of encoded horo strings in that class can be pairwise or multiple-sequence aligned to get the pattern for that class
- (FEATURE - DONE) There are two sets for each class after running the classifiers - one set is AscendantRelative and the other is Zodiacal
- (FEATURE - DONE) The above steps give the mined astronomical patterns for all observed mundane events - Pattern_Mundane_Observed_AscRelative and Pattern_Mundane_Observed_Zodiacal
60. (FEATURE - DONE) Above has implemented a basic Class and Inference Model that was envisaged in 2003. Class is the set-theoretic notion of sets sharing common underlying theme. Using VC Dimension is a way to determine accuracy of how well the dataset is "shattered" by the classes. 
64. (FEATURE - DONE-related to 65 and 139) Integrate AstroInfer,USB-md,KingCobra and VIRGO into an approximately intelligent cloud OS platform that not just executes code statically but also dynamically learns from the processes (say through log files, executables, execution times etc., and builds predictive models).
(FEATURE - DONE) 68. Music Pattern Mining - Computational Music - Alternatively, a Discrete Fourier Transform on a set of data or voice samples gives a set of frequencies - a traditional DSP paradigm.
69. (FEATURE - Audacity FFT - DONE) Music Pattern Mining - Experimental Idea of previous two points is to mine patterns in discrete data and voice(music for example) samples. Music as an expression of mathematics is widely studied as Musical Set Theory - Transpositions and Inversions (E.g http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_mathematics, http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-canons, http://www-personal.umd.umich.edu/~tmfiore/1/musictotal.pdf). Items 56,57 and 58 could help mining deep mathematical patterns in classical and other music and as a measure of similarity and creativity. In continuation of 68, following experiment was done on two eastern Indian Classical audio clips having similar raagas:

892. (FEATURE - DONE-minimum separate config file support in client and kernel service )1. More Sophisticated VIRGO config file and read_virgo_config() has to be invoked on syscall clients virgo_clone and virgo_malloc also. Earlier config was being read by kernel module only which would work only on a single machine. A separate config module kernel service has been added for future use while exporting kernel-wide configuration related symbols. VIRGO config files have been split into /etc/virgo_client.conf and /etc/virgo_cloud.conf to delink the cloud client and kernel service config parameters reading and to do away with oft occurring symbol lookup errors and multiple definition errors for num_cloud_nodes and node_ip_addrs_in_cloud - these errors are frequent in 3.15.5 kernel than 3.7.8 kernel. Each VIRGO module and system call now reads the config file independent of others - there is a read_virgo_config_<module>_<client_or_service>() function variant for each driver and system call. Though at present smacks of a replicated code, in future the config reads for each component (system call or module) might vary significantly depending on necessities.  New kernel module config has been added in drivers/virgo. This is for future prospective use as a config export driver that can be looked up by any other VIRGO module for config parameters.  include/linux/virgo_config.h has the declarations for all the config variables declared within each of the VIRGO kernel modules.  Config variables in each driver and system call have been named with prefix and suffix to differentiate the module and/or system call it serves.  In geographically distributed cloud virgo_client.conf has to be in client nodes and virgo_cloud.conf has to be in cloud nodes. For VIRGO Queue - KingCobra REQUEST-REPLY peer-to-peer messaging system same node can have virgo_client.conf and virgo_cloud.conf.  Above segregation largely simplifies the build process as each module and system call is independently built without need for a symbol to be exported from other module by pre-loading it.(- from commit comments done few months ago)
893. (FEATURE - Special case implementation DONE) 2. Object Marshalling and Unmarshalling (Serialization) Features - Feature 4 is a marshalling feature too as Python world PyObjects are serialized into VIRGO linux kernel and unmarshalled back bottom-up with CPython and Boost::Python C++ invocations - CPython and Boost internally take care of serialization.
894. (FEATURE - DONE) Virgo_malloc(), virgo_set(), virgo_get() and virgo_free() syscalls that virtualize the physical memory across all cloud nodes into a single logical memory behemoth (NUMA visavis UMA). (There are random crashes in copy_to_user and copy_from_user in syscall path for VIRGO memory pooling commands that were investigated but turned out to be mystery). These crashes have either been resolved or occur less in 3.15.5 and 4.1.5 kernels.
895. (FEATURE - DONE) Integrated testing of AsFer-VIRGO Linux Kernel request roundtrip - invocation of VIRGO linux kernel system calls from AsFer Python via C++ or C extensions - Commits for this have been done on 29 January 2016. This unifies userlevel applications and kernelspace modules so that AsFer Python makes VIRGO linux kernel an extension. Following is schematic diagram and More details in commit notes below.
896. (FEATURE - DONE) Multithreading of VIRGO cloudexec kernel module (if not already done by kernel module subsystem internally)
897. (FEATURE - DONE) Sophisticated queuing and persistence of CPU and Memory pooling requests in Kernel Side (by possibly improving already existing kernel workqueues). Either open source implementations like ZeroMQ/ActiveMQ can be used or Queuing implementation has to be written from scratch or both. ActiveMQ supports REST APIs and is JMS implementation. This feature has been marked completed because recently NeuronRain AsFer backend has been updated to support KingCobra REQUEST_REPLY.queue as a datasource for Streaming Abstract Generator. By enabling use_as_kingcobra_service=1 in cpupooling and memorypooling VIRGO drivers, any incoming CPU and Memory related request can be routed to KingCobra by linux workqueue in VIRGO queue and disk persisted (/var/log/REQUEST_REPLY.queue) by KingCobra servicerequest recipient. Also Kafka Publisher/Subscriber have been implemented in NeuronRain AsFer which invoke Streaming Abstract Generator with KingCobra REQUEST_REPLY.queue as datasource to publish persisted already received CPU and Memory requests to Kafka Message Queue. Thus queuing and persistence for VIRGO CPU and Memory is in place. ZeroMQ does not have persistence and is used for NeuronRain client side Router-Dealer concurrent request servicing pattern.
898. (FEATURE - DONE-Minimum Functionality - this section is an extended draft on respective topics in NeuronRain AstroInfer design -  https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/asfer-docs/AstroInferDesign.txt) Integration of Asfer(AstroInfer) algorithm codes into VIRGO which would add machine learning capabilities into VIRGO - That is, VIRGO cloud subsystem which is part of a linux kernel installation "learns" and "adapts" to the processes that are executed on VIRGO. This catapults the power of the Kernel and Operating System into an artificially (rather approximately naturally) intelligent computing platform (a software "brain"). For example VIRGO can "learn" about "execution times" of processes and suitably act for future processes. PAC Learning of functions could be theoretical basis for this.  Initial commits for Kernel Analytics Module which reads the /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf config have been done. This config file virgo_kernel_analytics.conf having csv(s) of key-value pairs of analytics variables is set by AsFer or any other Machine Learning code.  With this VIRGO Linux Kernel is endowed with abilities to dynamically evolve than being just a platform for user code. Implications are huge - for example, a config variable "MaxNetworkBandwidth=255" set by the ML miner in userspace based on a Perceptron or Logistic Regression executed on network logs can be read by a kernel module that limits the network traffic to 255Mbps. Thus kernel is no longer a static predictable blob behemoth. With this, VIRGO is an Internet-of-Things kernel that does analytics and based on analytics variable values integrated hardware can be controlled across the cloud through remote kernel module function invocation. This facility has been made dynamic with Boost::Python C++ and CPython extensions that permit flow of objects from machine learnt AsFer kernel analytics variables to VIRGO Linux Kernel memory drivers via VIRGO system calls directly and back - Commits on 29 January 2016 - this should obviate re-reading /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf and is an exemplary implementation which unifies C++/Python into C/Kernel.
900. (FEATURE - ONGOING) Virgo is an effort to virtualize the cloud as a single machine - Here cloud is not limited to servers and desktops but also mobile devices that run linux variants like Android, and other Mobile OSes. In the longterm, Virgo may have to be ported or optimized for handheld devices. Boost::Python AsFer-VIRGO system call invocations implemented in NeuronRain is framework for implementing python applications interfacing with kernel. If deployed on Mobile processors (e.g by overlaying Android Kernel with VIRGO layer) there are IDEs like QPython to develop python apps for Android.
901. (FEATURE - DONE) Memory Pooling Subsystem Driver - Virgo_malloc(), Virgo_set(), Virgo_get() and Virgo_free() system calls and their Kernel Module Implementations. In addition to syscall path, telnet or userspace socket client interface is also provided for both VIRGO CPU pooling(virgo_clone()) and VIRGO Memory Pooling Drivers.
902. (FEATURE - DONE) Virgo Cloud File System with virgo_cloud_open(), virgo_cloud_read() , virgo_cloud_write() and virgo_cloud_close() commands invoked through telnet path has been implemented that transcends disk storage in all nodes in the cloud. It is also fanciful feature addition that would make VIRGO a complete all-pervading cloud platform. The remote telnet clients send the file path and the buf to be read or data to be written. The Virgo File System kernel driver service creates a unique Virgo File Descriptor for each struct file* opened by filp_open() and is returned to client. Earlier design option to use a hashmap (linux/hashmap.h) looked less attractive as file desciptor is an obvious unique description for open file and also map becomes unscalable. The kernel upcall path has been implemented (paramIsExecutable=0) and may not be necessary in most cases and all above cloudfs commands work in kernelspace using VFS calls.
903. (FEATURE - DONE) VIRGO Cloud File System commands through syscall paths - virgo_open(),virgo_close(),virgo_read() and virgo_write(). All the syscalls have been implemented with testcases and more bugs fixed. After fullbuild and testing, virgo_open() and virgo_read() work and copy_to_user() is working.
904. (FEATURE - DONE) VIRGO memory pooling feature is also a distributed key-value store similar to other prominent key-store software like BigTable implementations, Dynamo, memory caching tools etc., but with a difference that VIRGO mempool is implemented as part of Linux Kernel itself thus circumventing userspace latencies. Due to Kernel space VIRGO mempool has an added power to store and retrieve key-value pair in hardware devices directly which otherwise is difficult in userspace implementations.
906. (FEATURE-DONE) Socket Debugging, Program Analysis and Verification features for user code that can find bugs statically. Socket skbuff debug utility and SATURN Program Analysis Software has been integrated into NEURONRAIN VIRGO Linux Kernel.
907. (FEATURE - DONE-Minimum Functionality) Operating System Logfile analysis using Machine Learning code in AstroInfer for finding patterns of processes execution and learn rules from the log. Kernel_Analytics VIRGO module reads /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf config key-value pairs which are set by AsFer or other Machine Learning Software. At present an Apache Spark usecase that mines Uncomplicated Fire Wall logs in kern.log for most prominent source IP has been implemented in AsFer codebase : http://sourceforge.net/p/asfer/code/704/tree/python-src/SparkKernelLogMapReduceParser.py . This is set as a key-value config in /etc/virgo_kernel_analytics.conf read and exported by kernel_analytics module.
911. (FEATURE - SATURN integration - minimum functionality DONE) Program Comprehension features as an add-on described in : https://sites.google.com/site/kuja27/PhDThesisProposal.pdf?attredirects=0. SATURN program analysis has been integrated into VIRGO linux with a stub driver.
912. (FEATURE - DONE) Bakery Algorithm implementation - cloudsync kernel module
913. (FEATURE - minimal EventNet Logical Clock primitive implemented in AstroInfer and this section is an extended draft on respective topics in NeuronRain AstroInfer design -  https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/asfer-docs/AstroInferDesign.txt) Implementation of Distributed Systems primitives for VIRGO cloud viz., Logical Clocks, Termination Detection, Snapshots, Cache Coherency subsystem etc.,(as part of cloudsync driver module). Already a simple timestamp generation feature has been implemented for KingCobra requests with <ipaddress>:<localmachinetimestamp> format
914. (FEATURE - minimum functionality DONE - this section is an extended draft on respective packing/filling/tiling topics in NeuronRain AstroInfer design specific to kernel SLAB allocator -  https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/asfer-github-code/blob/master/asfer-docs/AstroInferDesign.txt) Enhancements to kmem if it makes sense, because it is better to rely on virgo_malloc() for per machine memory management and wrap it around with a cloudwide VIRGO Unique ID based address lookup implementation of which is already in place.
915. (FEATURE - ONGOING) Cleanup the code and remove unnecessary comments.
916. (FEATURE - DONE) Documentation - This design document is also a documentation for commit notes and other build and debugging technical details. Doxygen html cross-reference documentation for AsFer, USBmd, VIRGO, KingCobra and Acadpdrafts has been created along with summed-up design document and committed to GitHub Repository at https://github.com/shrinivaasanka/Krishna_iResearch_DoxygenDocs
917. (FEATURE - DONE) Telnet path to virgo_cloud_malloc,virgo_cloud_set and virgo_cloud_get has been tested and working. This is similar to memcached but stores key-value in kernelspace (and hence has the ability to write to and retrieve from any device driver memory viz., cards, handheld devices).An optional todo is to write a script or userspace socket client that connects to VIRGO mempool driver for these commands.
919. (FEATURE - DONE) VIRGO queue driver with native userspace queue and kernel workqueue-handler framework that is optionally used for KingCobra and is invoked through VIRGO cpupooling and memorypooling drivers. (Schematic in http://sourceforge.net/p/kcobra/code-svn/HEAD/tree/KingCobraDesignNotes.txt and http://sourceforge.net/p/acadpdrafts/code/ci/master/tree/Krishna_iResearch_opensourceproducts_archdiagram.pdf)
920. (FEATURE - DONE) KERNELSPACE EXECUTION ACROSS CLOUD NODES which geographically distribute userspace and kernelspace execution creating 
921. (FEATURE - DONE) VIRGO platform as on 5 May 2014 implements a minimum set of features and kernelsocket commands required for a cloud OS kernel: CPU virtualization(virgo_clone), Memory virtualization(virgo_malloc,virgo_get,virgo_set,virgo_free) and a distributed cloud file system(virgo_open,virgo_close,virgo_read,virgo_write) on the cloud nodes and thus gives a logical view of one unified, distributed linux kernel across all cloud nodes that splits userspace and kernelspace execution across cloud as above.
922. (FEATURE - DONE) VIRGO Queue standalone kernel service has been implemented in addition to paths in schematics above. VIRGO Queue listens on hardcoded port 60000 and enqueues the incoming requests to VIRGO queue which is serviced by KingCobra:
923. (FEATURE - DONE) EventNet kernel module service:
924. (FEATURE - DONE) Related to point 22 - Reuse EventNet cloudwide logical time infinite graph in AsFer in place of Logical clocks. At present the eventnet driver listens on port 20000 and writes the edges and vertices files in kernel using vfs_read()/vfs_write(). These text files can then be read by the AsFer code to generate DOT files and visualize the graph with graphviz.
925. (FEATURE - OPTIONAL) The kernel modules services listening on ports could return a JSON response when connected instead of plaintext, conforming to REST protocol. Additional options for protocol buffers which are becoming a standard data interchange format.
926. (FEATURE-Minimum Functionality DONE) Pointer Swizzling and Unswizzling of VIRGO addressspace pointers to/from VIRGO Unique ID (VUID). Presently VIRGO memory system calls implement a basic minimal pointer address translation to unique kmem location identifier.

Intrinsic Merit ranking with Citation graph maxflow considering cloud as a flow network where a node positively or negatively cites or "opines" about a node, as mentioned in http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4458 (author's Master's thesis) and http://www.nist.gov/tac/publications/2010/participant.papers/CMI_IIT.proceedings.pdf(published by the author during PhD) give a p2p ranking of cloud nodes that can be used for analysis though may not be reliable fully. AsFer has bigdata analytics functionality that fits well to this point to analyse the problem reports with machine learning algorithms and set the key-value pairs that are read by VIRGO kernel_analytics module and exported kernelwide. The persisted REQUEST_REPLY.queue with the logged request-reply IPs and timestamps can be mined with AsFer bigdata capability (e.g. Spark)
