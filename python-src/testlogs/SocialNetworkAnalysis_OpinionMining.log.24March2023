The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has ordered the expansion of Chennai city from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 sq km, which will include as many as 1,225 new villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet areas.

The CMDA said on Twitter that the order was issued to ensure sustainable economic development of the Chennai region.

“To promote balanced urban growth in Chennai Metropolitan Area and to conserve, protect and manage the vast number of water bodies and green areas and also to ensure sustainable economic growth in Chennai region, the government has issued an order for expansion,” said the tweet.

The Minister for Housing and Urban Development S Muthusamy made the announcement in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

Muthusamy said that villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet will be added to the Chennai Metropolitan area.

According to the order released by Hitesh Kumar S Makwana, the principal secretary to the government, as many as 1,225 villages will now be a part of the Chennai Metropolitan planning area.

The Tamil Nadu government on Friday issued a government order, notifying the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) from its present size of 1,189 sq. km. to 5,904 sq. km. by including contiguous areas from Tiruvallur, Ranipet, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts.

According to the order issued by Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana, Principal Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department, a total of 1,225 villages from these four districts have been added to CMPA.

They include 550 villages from the Ponneri, Gummidipoondi, Uthukottai, Tiruvallur, Tiruttani, Poonamallee taluks of Tiruvallur district; 44 villages from the Arakkonam taluk of Ranipet district; 335 villages from the Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Sriperumbudur and Kundrathur taluks of Kancheepuram district; and 296 villages from the Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Tirukalukundram and Vandalur taluks of Chengalpattu district.

Ran into delays

The initiative began during the previous AIADMK government in 2018, but ran into delays. The processes, including the hearing of objections or suggestions from those in the areas proposed to be included, were expedited in the recent months. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin gave the final approval to the proposal at a meeting held this month.

Although it was originally envisaged to expand CMPA to around 8,800 sq. km., the areas has been reduced to 5,904 sq. km.

Official sources said the expansion would make CMPA comparable in size to the metropolitan planning areas of some of the other top cities in the country. Until now, Chennai was the smallest, compared with a few top cities in India.

With the order issued, the changes in the administrative set-up to effect the change will soon follow, sources added.

Anshul Mishra, Member-Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, said the expansion would help in a more balanced and well-planned growth of the region.

Better planning

He said it would facilitate better planning in terms of transport and resource management and help in the protection of water sources and green cover.

It would also help in better integration of nearby town centres with the city.

CHENNAI: After 10 years of deliberations over the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA), the State government on Friday issued a Government Order (GO) specifying the inclusion of more than 1,000 villages in Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Ranipet districts into the CMA.

The GO, which was issued on Friday, however, did not specify how many km will be expanded. It merely said that a proposal by the CMDA member secretary for expansion of CMA, for inclusion of contiguous area under Clause 23-a of Section -II of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, has been accepted.

This comes after Chief Minister MK Stalin reviewed the proposal earlier this month to expand CMA from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 km. Under that, the expanded areas were to be covered under regional plans and not the master plan. It is learnt that CMDA has suggested dividing the entire CMA into three. The existing Chennai Metropolitan Area could be termed as CMA Central and the proposed expanded areas as CMA North and CMA South.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight talukas, covering a distance of 2,908 sq km. These include Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. Similarly, the South CMA will have 1,809 sq km and it will include seven talukas - Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly). While the existing Chennai Metropolitan Area of 1,189 sq km will be considered CMA Central.

Hyderabad Metropolitan Region, which was formed by combining four districts of Rangareddy, Mahboobnagar, Nalgonda and Medak has the largest area of 7,222 sq km under its jurisdiction. With the proposed expansion to 5,904km, Chennai would be the second largest city followed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority which has an area of 4,355 sq km.

S Sridharan, Chairman of the Urban Development/Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI National) said with the expansion of CMA infrastructure funding will become easier. He also said it will result in organised growth.

CHENNAI: he year 2022 has seen Chennai’s metropolitan area expanding by five times on paper, and its implications on the ground are likely to be seen in 2023. With a total of 5,904 sq kilometres under the ambit of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), growth in the capital city’s surrounding regions might become more planned.

Similarly, the state government is expected to execute its plans to create an urban planning body exclusively for Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Hosur and Madurai. In the new year, these initiatives might largely shape the urban development in the four major urban clusters.

Besides the expansion of city limits, some of the other major projects that could help in Chennai’s growth are the five proposed satellite towns, the development of land around the Outer Ring Road, and the extension of metro rail to Sholinganallur.

Other projects, including the double-decker highway from Chennai Port to Maduravoyal and the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, are also on the anvil. However, experts warn that the expansion of the cities and its suburbs may adversely impact the environment. Former Anna University professor of Urban Engineering, KP Subramanian, said the city expansion will result in loss of biodiversity, forest cover, and waterbodies.

Aarthi Lakshminarayanan of the consulting firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, explained if the surrounding regions are developed, there would be a lesser influx of people to the city’s core. “The expansion of the city limits may lead to uniform growth in the regions surrounding the cities. This will help reduce the stress on the core city’s infrastructure and resources. It also makes way for better investment and uniform distribution opportunities both in the core city and the surrounding areas,” she pointed out.

A Shankar, Chief Operating Officer, Strategic Consulting and Valuation, JLL West Asia, a property consulting firm, said the expansion would succeed if the new areas are provided with growth corridors, and rail and road connectivity. “The formation of the new urban planning authorities (in Coimbatore and Tiruppur) decentralises the planning approvals and also allows the initiation of proposals for infrastructure development for urban plan areas in line with CMDA. This paves way for approaching the lending agencies which can contribute to major development of planning area of respective authorities,” says S Sridharan, Chairman, Urban Development Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.

Speaking to TNIE, Coimbatore Corporation commissioner M Prathap said, “The Tamil Nadu government is taking necessary steps in forming a CMDA-like body in Coimbatore. The Coimbatore city will likely be getting its own ‘Coimbatore Urban Development Authority (CUDA)’ by next year. A month ago, a G.O. was issued for the formation of the body. An IAS officer will be appointed to lead the CUDA. Once established and implemented, people constructing large infrastructure with a built-up area of over 10,000 sq.ft need not visit Chennai to apply for building plan approval with the DTCP. Instead, they can get it from CUDA.”

Tiruppur Exporters and Manufacturer Association (TEAMA) President MP Muthurathinam said, “Once Tiruppur Urban Development Authority takes off, we believe, it will be a game changer. We are yet to receive communication regarding the Urban Development Area and limits which could include villages near Tiruppur city. The area’s specification could be larger than the existing Tiruppur Local Planning Area. Besides, on the state level, we want a large textile zone comprising Tiruppur, Erode, and Karur.”

CHENNAI: The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has proposed to trifurcate the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), currently spread across 1,189 sqkm, into Chennai Metropolitan Area Central encompassing core city areas and Chennai Metropolitan Area North and Chennai Metropolitan Area South.

The previous AIADMK government has planned to increase the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm making it the second largest city in the country. The new DMK government, however, has decided to rework the plan and extend the city’s metropolitan area to up to 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, a review meeting to be held under Chief Minister M K Stalin on the proposed expansion of the CMA on Tuesday has been postponed to next month, and is likely to be held after pooja holidays (October 4 and 5).

The proposed third master plan will not cover the extended areas and separate regional plans will be prepared for their development, officials said. The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm spread over Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The CMA South will extend over an area 1,809 sqkm .

‘First justify the need for expansion of CMA’

It will cover Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly) taluks. The two CMAs will have their respective regional offices. The planning wing of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning in the expanded areas may be merged with CMA Central, sources said.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering K P Subramanian said the CMDA should first justify the need for expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area. “They must institute an independent and impartial committee to decide on the issue with expert input and public consultation.

The CMDA couldn’t accomplish even certain legal obligations and a large number of projects formulated in I and II Master Plans. The expansion would only result in urban sprawls and indiscriminate conversion of fertile agricultural lands to urban development leading to environmental degradation and ecological inequilibrium,” says the former professor.

“In the above situation it’s not clear as to why the CMDA is determined to expand after aborting the master plans already in force and dissolving the existing Local Planning and the New Town Development Authorities operating in the area proposed to be expanded” he added.

Association of Professional Town Planners (APTP) president K M Sadanandh said the trifurcation won’t make any change. Chennai Metropolitan Area should analyse its own capacity and then go in for expansion. “It should assess growth potential and plan for the next 20 years as the expansion is about four and half times the original size. The focus should be on how such a large area could be administered. It should involve almost all the departments and not just a few agencies,” he said.

CHENNAI: Chief Minister M K Stalin on Tuesday reviewed the CMDA’s proposal to expand the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) which has been pending for a long time.

The previous AIADMK government wanted to expand the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm. While the expansion of Chennai Metropolitan Area as envisaged under the earlier plan would have made the city the second largest in the country, the new plan proposes the CMA to cover an area of 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, CMDA has suggested trifurcation of the metropolitan area, with the existing CMA being known as CMA Central and expanded areas being called CMA North and CMA South. The expanded areas would be covered under regional plans and not master plan, official sources said.

Residents in 28 Assembly constituencies of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), covering 1,189 sq.km, will start consultations with officials for the preparation of a vision document for the Third Master Plan 2027-2046.

As the expansion of the metropolitan planning area is expected to be notified shortly, a regional planning approach will be adopted in the expanded areas of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) and likely to be integrated with the Third Master Plan. Currently, the Master Plan efforts are focused on the existing CMA.

Housing and Urban Development Minister S. Muthusamy on Monday launched the process of stakeholder engagement for the preparation of the vision document. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) on Monday also launched a workshop and consultation to solicit the views of various stakeholders in the city.

Stakeholders, including residents, have been requested to give their views online at http://cmavision.in . The information will help the CMDA understand citizen perceptions on the future vision for the CMA. Residents will also be permitted to give suggestions to officials during the public consultations.

Launching the portal, Mr. Muthusamy said the officials of the CMDA would visit every village in the metropolitan area to get suggestions from residents. “Public consultation is very important. Residents will be able to give innovative ideas about urban planning,” the Minister said.

Pointing to the need for widening of arterial roads, such as Anna Salai, he said the master plan would facilitate planned urban development in newly-developing areas and prevent the need for frequent widening of roads in the future. Stressing the need for urban development of villages, Mr. Muthusamy said, “We are also planning to implement land pooling for development of villages along 62 km of Outer Ring Road.”

Speaking about redevelopment, Mr. Muthusamy said the Chief Minister had directed officers to redevelop old projects of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). “Many TNHB houses that were constructed more than 30 years ago are dilapidated,” he said.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Hitesh Kumar Makwana said the work to prepare the Third Master Plan, a statutory document, would start this year. “Amendment of rules will be done to add items that were not in the rules, such as GIS and coastal zone management. We will notify the rules in April, and the plan will be notified between December 2025 and April 2026,” he said. “Master plans for other areas, such as Hosur, have been prepared. Coimbatore is ready. Over 20 master plans will be prepared in the State,” he added.

The Third Master Plan will be prepared only for 1,189 sq.km. The boundary expansion of the CMA will be notified shortly. But the expanded area will only have regional planning, said Mr. Makwana.

CMDA Member Secretary Anshul Mishra stressed the need for sustainable development and economically vibrant, inclusive and climate-resilient planning in the CMA. The CMDA has planned to formulate a holistic, integrated master plan.

In pursuit of change, the CMDA would focus on transit-oriented development, land pooling and redevelopment, grid of roads, form-based codes, climate-resilient planning, tourism and waterfront development and heritage conservation, he said. CMDA would listen to the needs of residents and the long term plans of line agencies before the formulation of the Third Master Plan, Mr. Mishra said.

CMDA has started studies on land value and density distribution, review of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, strategic institutional strengthening assessment and action plan for the CMDA, factual distribution of employment and income category and agglomeration economics, integrated blue green infrastructure and urban heat island effect ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan, he said.

“We have assessed the best practices in the vision statements of cities such as Singapore, Bangkok, Manchester, Sydney and Seoul,” Mr. Mishra said.

Revenue Secretary Kumar Jayant said the consultation should involve other departments ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan.

Representatives from the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disability and local bodies participated and gave suggestions, including economic development of native population, heritage tourism, solid waste management, women safety and priority for accessibility in every segment. The visioning process for the Third Master Plan included analysis of economic development, housing growth, traffic and transportation, infrastructure, safety and security, resilience, heritage and technology with gender equality as the central aspect.

CHENNAI: Tucked away almost 60km away from the Chennai International Airport lies Parandur, the site for Chennai's second airport that is devoid of any major infrastructure or connectivity. But the site, which was in competition with Pannur, was selected due to its closeness to Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway.

"Parandur was selected as it was only 7km to 8km away from the upcoming Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway, for which the work is underway. The 262-km-long, six-lane, access-controlled expressway, which begins at Hoskote in Karnataka and ends at Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Chennai could play a major role in the connectivity to the airport," official sources said.

Another major connectivity to the second airport is likely to be the Chennai Metro Rail. The government has recently announced plans to extend Corridor-4, which is from Light House to Poonamallee Bypass to Sriperumbudur. A feasibility study is going to be conducted.

Official sources told TNIE that it was likely that the metro rail connectivity could be extended to Parandur. While the project is likely to take another 10 years to get implemented, the city is likely to expand beyond ORR with the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) planning to open up the land parcels in and around ORR.

A report prepared for the CMDA has suggested large-scale housing, industrial and commercial developments. Official sources said the study was undertaken by keeping in mind that the transit-oriented development concepts across key corridors like in Delhi and Ahmedabad and international models like that of Curitiba, the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Paraná, and Portland, the largest and most populous city in the US state of Oregon.

According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association (CREDAI), the second airport will give a big push to the aviation sector in Parandur. "It's paramount that connectivity to the airport is well planned and executed in the models of international cities. This should give a fillip to the setting up of ancillary and support industries in the corridor," CREDAI stated. Interestingly, the site is located closer to various industrial parks in Sriperumbudur. This includes the aerospace park.

Air quality of Chennai deteriorates on Deepavali

On the day of Deepavali, Chennai saw skyrocketing levels of air pollution. Pic: Wikimedia Commons

Air quality in Chennai on this Deepavali was worse than the city’s lowest on record in 2020. As recorded by the TNPCB’s air quality monitors, AQI (Air Quality Index) oscillated between “poor” and “severe” ranges of 345 and 786. This increased the risk of respiratory illnesses in Chennai.

Besant Nagar had an AQI of 345, which was “poor” and Sowcarpet’s AQI was 786, which fell in the “severe” category. According to experts, the severe AQI level in Sowcarpet is equivalent to a person smoking 31 cigarettes in one day.

During Deepavali, PM 2.5, the most dangerous particulate matter in the air in Chennai, reached a level of 500 units on October 25th, while the recommended PM 2.5 level is 60 units.

Excessive bursting of fireworks, high relative humidity and low wind speed were the main reasons for high pollution levels in Chennai, explained the TNPCB authorities. In other words, smoke from the crackers did not escape easily due to the climatic conditions.

Buckingham Canal soon to be free of sewage: Metrowater

After clearing encroachments, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) will stop sewage water from flowing into the Buckingham Canal.

In the wake of sewage leaking into the waters of Cooum, Adyar and Buckingham Canal, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the water department about the mitigation efforts in keeping the water sources clean.

Across Cooum, Metrowater has taken up diversion and interception in 10 places. To stop sewage illegally flowing into the Adyar river, Rs 555 crores have been allotted to the Chennai River Restoration Trust.

Metrowater has laid underground sewage connections in areas including Perungudi, Karapakkam, Ullagaram, Madhavaram and Ramapuram, among other localities in Chennai.

Fall into SWD pits proves fatal for journalist

On October 22nd, a journalist fell into a stormwater drain pit near Kasi theatre, in Jafferkhanpet. 23-year-old Muthukrishnan was returning from work when the mishap took place. Witnesses and his colleagues claimed that it took an hour for people to notice him inside the pit. Later, he was admitted to Royapettah Government Hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

The Greater Chennai Corporation issued a clarification that the SWD work in that area fell under the ambit of the Department of Highways. Residents have complained against the manner in which SWD construction is being undertaken, with a lack of barricades and rods lying open, making vast stretches of roads in the city unsafe.

CHENNAI: The State government will now come out with a new transport roadmap for the Chennai Metropolitan Area till 2048, which will synchronise with the Third Master Plan (TMP), said official sources.

This comes as the present Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) for Chennai Metropolitan Area, which was prepared during the AIADMK regime, is being reviewed by the government. The mobility plan proposed an investment plan of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which was to be finalised after the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority holds its first meeting. But now, officials say it is unlikely to happen.

The idea is that development and transport infrastructure should go together. While the third masterplan is a long exercise, sources say the comprehensive mobility plan is likely to come up in the next 18 months once the State government gives its approval.

The Comprehensive Urban Mobility Plan was prepared after the State planned to improve upon the outdated Chennai Comprehensive Transportation Study (CCTS) that was unveiled in August 2010. The CCTS focused on the mobility needs of car users, while the comprehensive mobility plan was to address the mobility needs of all people and the infrastructure required for all modes, as well as to integrate both the land use (i.e., the spatial distribution of activities) and transport systems.

Official sources told TNIE that the present CMP focussed only on Metro rail corridors and could not take into account the expansion of the city. “We are waiting for in-principle approval from the State government,” sources said. It is learnt once the file is cleared, a tender will be floated to find a consultant.

“The plan is likely for 20 years and will be an evolving one. It will be frequently updated every four or five years,” sources said. This could mean the plan will take into account the new airport and electric vehicles and the proposed satellite cities, besides the proposed expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Area, including the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, among others.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering KP Subramanian, however, questioned the decision of going in for a new comprehensive plan without implementing the existing one. “There is no reason why the plan should be aborted even without giving a fair trial of implementation, and opting for preparation of a new plan when the process to prepare for the TMP has been rolled out. The ideal approach will be to make the CMP an integral part of the TMP,” he said.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has ordered the expansion of Chennai city from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 sq km, which will include as many as 1,225 new villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet areas.

The CMDA said on Twitter that the order was issued to ensure sustainable economic development of the Chennai region.

“To promote balanced urban growth in Chennai Metropolitan Area and to conserve, protect and manage the vast number of water bodies and green areas and also to ensure sustainable economic growth in Chennai region, the government has issued an order for expansion,” said the tweet.

The Minister for Housing and Urban Development S Muthusamy made the announcement in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

Muthusamy said that villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet will be added to the Chennai Metropolitan area.

According to the order released by Hitesh Kumar S Makwana, the principal secretary to the government, as many as 1,225 villages will now be a part of the Chennai Metropolitan planning area.
October 22, 2022 12:08 am | Updated 01:57 am IST - CHENNAI

The Tamil Nadu government on Friday issued a government order, notifying the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) from its present size of 1,189 sq. km. to 5,904 sq. km. by including contiguous areas from Tiruvallur, Ranipet, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts.

According to the order issued by Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana, Principal Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department, a total of 1,225 villages from these four districts have been added to CMPA.

They include 550 villages from the Ponneri, Gummidipoondi, Uthukottai, Tiruvallur, Tiruttani, Poonamallee taluks of Tiruvallur district; 44 villages from the Arakkonam taluk of Ranipet district; 335 villages from the Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Sriperumbudur and Kundrathur taluks of Kancheepuram district; and 296 villages from the Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Tirukalukundram and Vandalur taluks of Chengalpattu district.

Ran into delays

The initiative began during the previous AIADMK government in 2018, but ran into delays. The processes, including the hearing of objections or suggestions from those in the areas proposed to be included, were expedited in the recent months. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin gave the final approval to the proposal at a meeting held this month.

Although it was originally envisaged to expand CMPA to around 8,800 sq. km., the areas has been reduced to 5,904 sq. km.

Official sources said the expansion would make CMPA comparable in size to the metropolitan planning areas of some of the other top cities in the country. Until now, Chennai was the smallest, compared with a few top cities in India.

With the order issued, the changes in the administrative set-up to effect the change will soon follow, sources added.

Anshul Mishra, Member-Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, said the expansion would help in a more balanced and well-planned growth of the region.

Better planning

He said it would facilitate better planning in terms of transport and resource management and help in the protection of water sources and green cover.

It would also help in better integration of nearby town centres with the city.

CHENNAI: After 10 years of deliberations over the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA), the State government on Friday issued a Government Order (GO) specifying the inclusion of more than 1,000 villages in Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Ranipet districts into the CMA.

The GO, which was issued on Friday, however, did not specify how many km will be expanded. It merely said that a proposal by the CMDA member secretary for expansion of CMA, for inclusion of contiguous area under Clause 23-a of Section -II of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, has been accepted.

This comes after Chief Minister MK Stalin reviewed the proposal earlier this month to expand CMA from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 km. Under that, the expanded areas were to be covered under regional plans and not the master plan. It is learnt that CMDA has suggested dividing the entire CMA into three. The existing Chennai Metropolitan Area could be termed as CMA Central and the proposed expanded areas as CMA North and CMA South.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight talukas, covering a distance of 2,908 sq km. These include Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. Similarly, the South CMA will have 1,809 sq km and it will include seven talukas - Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly). While the existing Chennai Metropolitan Area of 1,189 sq km will be considered CMA Central.

Hyderabad Metropolitan Region, which was formed by combining four districts of Rangareddy, Mahboobnagar, Nalgonda and Medak has the largest area of 7,222 sq km under its jurisdiction. With the proposed expansion to 5,904km, Chennai would be the second largest city followed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority which has an area of 4,355 sq km.

S Sridharan, Chairman of the Urban Development/Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI National) said with the expansion of CMA infrastructure funding will become easier. He also said it will result in organised growth.

CHENNAI: he year 2022 has seen Chennai’s metropolitan area expanding by five times on paper, and its implications on the ground are likely to be seen in 2023. With a total of 5,904 sq kilometres under the ambit of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), growth in the capital city’s surrounding regions might become more planned.

Similarly, the state government is expected to execute its plans to create an urban planning body exclusively for Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Hosur and Madurai. In the new year, these initiatives might largely shape the urban development in the four major urban clusters.

Besides the expansion of city limits, some of the other major projects that could help in Chennai’s growth are the five proposed satellite towns, the development of land around the Outer Ring Road, and the extension of metro rail to Sholinganallur.

Other projects, including the double-decker highway from Chennai Port to Maduravoyal and the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, are also on the anvil. However, experts warn that the expansion of the cities and its suburbs may adversely impact the environment. Former Anna University professor of Urban Engineering, KP Subramanian, said the city expansion will result in loss of biodiversity, forest cover, and waterbodies.

Aarthi Lakshminarayanan of the consulting firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, explained if the surrounding regions are developed, there would be a lesser influx of people to the city’s core. “The expansion of the city limits may lead to uniform growth in the regions surrounding the cities. This will help reduce the stress on the core city’s infrastructure and resources. It also makes way for better investment and uniform distribution opportunities both in the core city and the surrounding areas,” she pointed out.

A Shankar, Chief Operating Officer, Strategic Consulting and Valuation, JLL West Asia, a property consulting firm, said the expansion would succeed if the new areas are provided with growth corridors, and rail and road connectivity. “The formation of the new urban planning authorities (in Coimbatore and Tiruppur) decentralises the planning approvals and also allows the initiation of proposals for infrastructure development for urban plan areas in line with CMDA. This paves way for approaching the lending agencies which can contribute to major development of planning area of respective authorities,” says S Sridharan, Chairman, Urban Development Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.

Speaking to TNIE, Coimbatore Corporation commissioner M Prathap said, “The Tamil Nadu government is taking necessary steps in forming a CMDA-like body in Coimbatore. The Coimbatore city will likely be getting its own ‘Coimbatore Urban Development Authority (CUDA)’ by next year. A month ago, a G.O. was issued for the formation of the body. An IAS officer will be appointed to lead the CUDA. Once established and implemented, people constructing large infrastructure with a built-up area of over 10,000 sq.ft need not visit Chennai to apply for building plan approval with the DTCP. Instead, they can get it from CUDA.”

Tiruppur Exporters and Manufacturer Association (TEAMA) President MP Muthurathinam said, “Once Tiruppur Urban Development Authority takes off, we believe, it will be a game changer. We are yet to receive communication regarding the Urban Development Area and limits which could include villages near Tiruppur city. The area’s specification could be larger than the existing Tiruppur Local Planning Area. Besides, on the state level, we want a large textile zone comprising Tiruppur, Erode, and Karur.”

CHENNAI: The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has proposed to trifurcate the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), currently spread across 1,189 sqkm, into Chennai Metropolitan Area Central encompassing core city areas and Chennai Metropolitan Area North and Chennai Metropolitan Area South.

The previous AIADMK government has planned to increase the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm making it the second largest city in the country. The new DMK government, however, has decided to rework the plan and extend the city’s metropolitan area to up to 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, a review meeting to be held under Chief Minister M K Stalin on the proposed expansion of the CMA on Tuesday has been postponed to next month, and is likely to be held after pooja holidays (October 4 and 5).

The proposed third master plan will not cover the extended areas and separate regional plans will be prepared for their development, officials said. The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm spread over Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The CMA South will extend over an area 1,809 sqkm .

‘First justify the need for expansion of CMA’

It will cover Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly) taluks. The two CMAs will have their respective regional offices. The planning wing of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning in the expanded areas may be merged with CMA Central, sources said.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering K P Subramanian said the CMDA should first justify the need for expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area. “They must institute an independent and impartial committee to decide on the issue with expert input and public consultation.

The CMDA couldn’t accomplish even certain legal obligations and a large number of projects formulated in I and II Master Plans. The expansion would only result in urban sprawls and indiscriminate conversion of fertile agricultural lands to urban development leading to environmental degradation and ecological inequilibrium,” says the former professor.

“In the above situation it’s not clear as to why the CMDA is determined to expand after aborting the master plans already in force and dissolving the existing Local Planning and the New Town Development Authorities operating in the area proposed to be expanded” he added.

Association of Professional Town Planners (APTP) president K M Sadanandh said the trifurcation won’t make any change. Chennai Metropolitan Area should analyse its own capacity and then go in for expansion. “It should assess growth potential and plan for the next 20 years as the expansion is about four and half times the original size. The focus should be on how such a large area could be administered. It should involve almost all the departments and not just a few agencies,” he said.

CHENNAI: Chief Minister M K Stalin on Tuesday reviewed the CMDA’s proposal to expand the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) which has been pending for a long time.

The previous AIADMK government wanted to expand the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm. While the expansion of Chennai Metropolitan Area as envisaged under the earlier plan would have made the city the second largest in the country, the new plan proposes the CMA to cover an area of 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, CMDA has suggested trifurcation of the metropolitan area, with the existing CMA being known as CMA Central and expanded areas being called CMA North and CMA South. The expanded areas would be covered under regional plans and not master plan, official sources said.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm including Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur.

Residents in 28 Assembly constituencies of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), covering 1,189 sq.km, will start consultations with officials for the preparation of a vision document for the Third Master Plan 2027-2046.

As the expansion of the metropolitan planning area is expected to be notified shortly, a regional planning approach will be adopted in the expanded areas of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) and likely to be integrated with the Third Master Plan. Currently, the Master Plan efforts are focused on the existing CMA.

Housing and Urban Development Minister S. Muthusamy on Monday launched the process of stakeholder engagement for the preparation of the vision document. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) on Monday also launched a workshop and consultation to solicit the views of various stakeholders in the city.

Stakeholders, including residents, have been requested to give their views online at http://cmavision.in . The information will help the CMDA understand citizen perceptions on the future vision for the CMA. Residents will also be permitted to give suggestions to officials during the public consultations.

Launching the portal, Mr. Muthusamy said the officials of the CMDA would visit every village in the metropolitan area to get suggestions from residents. “Public consultation is very important. Residents will be able to give innovative ideas about urban planning,” the Minister said.

Pointing to the need for widening of arterial roads, such as Anna Salai, he said the master plan would facilitate planned urban development in newly-developing areas and prevent the need for frequent widening of roads in the future. Stressing the need for urban development of villages, Mr. Muthusamy said, “We are also planning to implement land pooling for development of villages along 62 km of Outer Ring Road.”

Speaking about redevelopment, Mr. Muthusamy said the Chief Minister had directed officers to redevelop old projects of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). “Many TNHB houses that were constructed more than 30 years ago are dilapidated,” he said.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Hitesh Kumar Makwana said the work to prepare the Third Master Plan, a statutory document, would start this year. “Amendment of rules will be done to add items that were not in the rules, such as GIS and coastal zone management. We will notify the rules in April, and the plan will be notified between December 2025 and April 2026,” he said. “Master plans for other areas, such as Hosur, have been prepared. Coimbatore is ready. Over 20 master plans will be prepared in the State,” he added.

The Third Master Plan will be prepared only for 1,189 sq.km. The boundary expansion of the CMA will be notified shortly. But the expanded area will only have regional planning, said Mr. Makwana.

CMDA Member Secretary Anshul Mishra stressed the need for sustainable development and economically vibrant, inclusive and climate-resilient planning in the CMA. The CMDA has planned to formulate a holistic, integrated master plan.

In pursuit of change, the CMDA would focus on transit-oriented development, land pooling and redevelopment, grid of roads, form-based codes, climate-resilient planning, tourism and waterfront development and heritage conservation, he said. CMDA would listen to the needs of residents and the long term plans of line agencies before the formulation of the Third Master Plan, Mr. Mishra said.

CMDA has started studies on land value and density distribution, review of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, strategic institutional strengthening assessment and action plan for the CMDA, factual distribution of employment and income category and agglomeration economics, integrated blue green infrastructure and urban heat island effect ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan, he said.

“We have assessed the best practices in the vision statements of cities such as Singapore, Bangkok, Manchester, Sydney and Seoul,” Mr. Mishra said.

Revenue Secretary Kumar Jayant said the consultation should involve other departments ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan.

Representatives from the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disability and local bodies participated and gave suggestions, including economic development of native population, heritage tourism, solid waste management, women safety and priority for accessibility in every segment. The visioning process for the Third Master Plan included analysis of economic development, housing growth, traffic and transportation, infrastructure, safety and security, resilience, heritage and technology with gender equality as the central aspect.

CHENNAI: Tucked away almost 60km away from the Chennai International Airport lies Parandur, the site for Chennai's second airport that is devoid of any major infrastructure or connectivity. But the site, which was in competition with Pannur, was selected due to its closeness to Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway.

"Parandur was selected as it was only 7km to 8km away from the upcoming Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway, for which the work is underway. The 262-km-long, six-lane, access-controlled expressway, which begins at Hoskote in Karnataka and ends at Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Chennai could play a major role in the connectivity to the airport," official sources said.

Another major connectivity to the second airport is likely to be the Chennai Metro Rail. The government has recently announced plans to extend Corridor-4, which is from Light House to Poonamallee Bypass to Sriperumbudur. A feasibility study is going to be conducted.

Official sources told TNIE that it was likely that the metro rail connectivity could be extended to Parandur. While the project is likely to take another 10 years to get implemented, the city is likely to expand beyond ORR with the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) planning to open up the land parcels in and around ORR.

A report prepared for the CMDA has suggested large-scale housing, industrial and commercial developments. Official sources said the study was undertaken by keeping in mind that the transit-oriented development concepts across key corridors like in Delhi and Ahmedabad and international models like that of Curitiba, the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Paraná, and Portland, the largest and most populous city in the US state of Oregon.

According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association (CREDAI), the second airport will give a big push to the aviation sector in Parandur. "It's paramount that connectivity to the airport is well planned and executed in the models of international cities. This should give a fillip to the setting up of ancillary and support industries in the corridor," CREDAI stated. Interestingly, the site is located closer to various industrial parks in Sriperumbudur. This includes the aerospace park.

Air quality of Chennai deteriorates on Deepavali

On the day of Deepavali, Chennai saw skyrocketing levels of air pollution. Pic: Wikimedia Commons

Air quality in Chennai on this Deepavali was worse than the city’s lowest on record in 2020. As recorded by the TNPCB’s air quality monitors, AQI (Air Quality Index) oscillated between “poor” and “severe” ranges of 345 and 786. This increased the risk of respiratory illnesses in Chennai.

Besant Nagar had an AQI of 345, which was “poor” and Sowcarpet’s AQI was 786, which fell in the “severe” category. According to experts, the severe AQI level in Sowcarpet is equivalent to a person smoking 31 cigarettes in one day.

During Deepavali, PM 2.5, the most dangerous particulate matter in the air in Chennai, reached a level of 500 units on October 25th, while the recommended PM 2.5 level is 60 units.

Excessive bursting of fireworks, high relative humidity and low wind speed were the main reasons for high pollution levels in Chennai, explained the TNPCB authorities. In other words, smoke from the crackers did not escape easily due to the climatic conditions.

Buckingham Canal soon to be free of sewage: Metrowater

After clearing encroachments, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) will stop sewage water from flowing into the Buckingham Canal.

In the wake of sewage leaking into the waters of Cooum, Adyar and Buckingham Canal, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the water department about the mitigation efforts in keeping the water sources clean.

Across Cooum, Metrowater has taken up diversion and interception in 10 places. To stop sewage illegally flowing into the Adyar river, Rs 555 crores have been allotted to the Chennai River Restoration Trust.

Metrowater has laid underground sewage connections in areas including Perungudi, Karapakkam, Ullagaram, Madhavaram and Ramapuram, among other localities in Chennai.

Fall into SWD pits proves fatal for journalist

On October 22nd, a journalist fell into a stormwater drain pit near Kasi theatre, in Jafferkhanpet. 23-year-old Muthukrishnan was returning from work when the mishap took place. Witnesses and his colleagues claimed that it took an hour for people to notice him inside the pit. Later, he was admitted to Royapettah Government Hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

The Greater Chennai Corporation issued a clarification that the SWD work in that area fell under the ambit of the Department of Highways. Residents have complained against the manner in which SWD construction is being undertaken, with a lack of barricades and rods lying open, making vast stretches of roads in the city unsafe.

CHENNAI: The State government will now come out with a new transport roadmap for the Chennai Metropolitan Area till 2048, which will synchronise with the Third Master Plan (TMP), said official sources.

This comes as the present Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) for Chennai Metropolitan Area, which was prepared during the AIADMK regime, is being reviewed by the government. The mobility plan proposed an investment plan of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which was to be finalised after the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority holds its first meeting. But now, officials say it is unlikely to happen.

The idea is that development and transport infrastructure should go together. While the third masterplan is a long exercise, sources say the comprehensive mobility plan is likely to come up in the next 18 months once the State government gives its approval.

The Comprehensive Urban Mobility Plan was prepared after the State planned to improve upon the outdated Chennai Comprehensive Transportation Study (CCTS) that was unveiled in August 2010. The CCTS focused on the mobility needs of car users, while the comprehensive mobility plan was to address the mobility needs of all people and the infrastructure required for all modes, as well as to integrate both the land use (i.e., the spatial distribution of activities) and transport systems.

Official sources told TNIE that the present CMP focussed only on Metro rail corridors and could not take into account the expansion of the city. “We are waiting for in-principle approval from the State government,” sources said. It is learnt once the file is cleared, a tender will be floated to find a consultant.

“The plan is likely for 20 years and will be an evolving one. It will be frequently updated every four or five years,” sources said. This could mean the plan will take into account the new airport and electric vehicles and the proposed satellite cities, besides the proposed expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Area, including the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, among others.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering KP Subramanian, however, questioned the decision of going in for a new comprehensive plan without implementing the existing one. “There is no reason why the plan should be aborted even without giving a fair trial of implementation, and opting for preparation of a new plan when the process to prepare for the TMP has been rolled out. The ideal approach will be to make the CMP an integral part of the TMP,” he said.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has ordered the expansion of Chennai city from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 sq km, which will include as many as 1,225 new villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet areas.

The CMDA said on Twitter that the order was issued to ensure sustainable economic development of the Chennai region.

“To promote balanced urban growth in Chennai Metropolitan Area and to conserve, protect and manage the vast number of water bodies and green areas and also to ensure sustainable economic growth in Chennai region, the government has issued an order for expansion,” said the tweet.

The Minister for Housing and Urban Development S Muthusamy made the announcement in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

Muthusamy said that villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet will be added to the Chennai Metropolitan area.

According to the order released by Hitesh Kumar S Makwana, the principal secretary to the government, as many as 1,225 villages will now be a part of the Chennai Metropolitan planning area.
October 22, 2022 12:08 am | Updated 01:57 am IST - CHENNAI

The Tamil Nadu government on Friday issued a government order, notifying the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) from its present size of 1,189 sq. km. to 5,904 sq. km. by including contiguous areas from Tiruvallur, Ranipet, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts.

According to the order issued by Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana, Principal Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department, a total of 1,225 villages from these four districts have been added to CMPA.

They include 550 villages from the Ponneri, Gummidipoondi, Uthukottai, Tiruvallur, Tiruttani, Poonamallee taluks of Tiruvallur district; 44 villages from the Arakkonam taluk of Ranipet district; 335 villages from the Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Sriperumbudur and Kundrathur taluks of Kancheepuram district; and 296 villages from the Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Tirukalukundram and Vandalur taluks of Chengalpattu district.

Ran into delays

The initiative began during the previous AIADMK government in 2018, but ran into delays. The processes, including the hearing of objections or suggestions from those in the areas proposed to be included, were expedited in the recent months. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin gave the final approval to the proposal at a meeting held this month.

Although it was originally envisaged to expand CMPA to around 8,800 sq. km., the areas has been reduced to 5,904 sq. km.

Official sources said the expansion would make CMPA comparable in size to the metropolitan planning areas of some of the other top cities in the country. Until now, Chennai was the smallest, compared with a few top cities in India.

With the order issued, the changes in the administrative set-up to effect the change will soon follow, sources added.

Anshul Mishra, Member-Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, said the expansion would help in a more balanced and well-planned growth of the region.

Better planning

He said it would facilitate better planning in terms of transport and resource management and help in the protection of water sources and green cover.

It would also help in better integration of nearby town centres with the city.

CHENNAI: After 10 years of deliberations over the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA), the State government on Friday issued a Government Order (GO) specifying the inclusion of more than 1,000 villages in Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Ranipet districts into the CMA.

The GO, which was issued on Friday, however, did not specify how many km will be expanded. It merely said that a proposal by the CMDA member secretary for expansion of CMA, for inclusion of contiguous area under Clause 23-a of Section -II of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, has been accepted.

This comes after Chief Minister MK Stalin reviewed the proposal earlier this month to expand CMA from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 km. Under that, the expanded areas were to be covered under regional plans and not the master plan. It is learnt that CMDA has suggested dividing the entire CMA into three. The existing Chennai Metropolitan Area could be termed as CMA Central and the proposed expanded areas as CMA North and CMA South.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight talukas, covering a distance of 2,908 sq km. These include Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. Similarly, the South CMA will have 1,809 sq km and it will include seven talukas - Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly). While the existing Chennai Metropolitan Area of 1,189 sq km will be considered CMA Central.

Hyderabad Metropolitan Region, which was formed by combining four districts of Rangareddy, Mahboobnagar, Nalgonda and Medak has the largest area of 7,222 sq km under its jurisdiction. With the proposed expansion to 5,904km, Chennai would be the second largest city followed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority which has an area of 4,355 sq km.

S Sridharan, Chairman of the Urban Development/Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI National) said with the expansion of CMA infrastructure funding will become easier. He also said it will result in organised growth.

CHENNAI: he year 2022 has seen Chennai’s metropolitan area expanding by five times on paper, and its implications on the ground are likely to be seen in 2023. With a total of 5,904 sq kilometres under the ambit of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), growth in the capital city’s surrounding regions might become more planned.

Similarly, the state government is expected to execute its plans to create an urban planning body exclusively for Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Hosur and Madurai. In the new year, these initiatives might largely shape the urban development in the four major urban clusters.

Besides the expansion of city limits, some of the other major projects that could help in Chennai’s growth are the five proposed satellite towns, the development of land around the Outer Ring Road, and the extension of metro rail to Sholinganallur.

Other projects, including the double-decker highway from Chennai Port to Maduravoyal and the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, are also on the anvil. However, experts warn that the expansion of the cities and its suburbs may adversely impact the environment. Former Anna University professor of Urban Engineering, KP Subramanian, said the city expansion will result in loss of biodiversity, forest cover, and waterbodies.

Aarthi Lakshminarayanan of the consulting firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, explained if the surrounding regions are developed, there would be a lesser influx of people to the city’s core. “The expansion of the city limits may lead to uniform growth in the regions surrounding the cities. This will help reduce the stress on the core city’s infrastructure and resources. It also makes way for better investment and uniform distribution opportunities both in the core city and the surrounding areas,” she pointed out.

A Shankar, Chief Operating Officer, Strategic Consulting and Valuation, JLL West Asia, a property consulting firm, said the expansion would succeed if the new areas are provided with growth corridors, and rail and road connectivity. “The formation of the new urban planning authorities (in Coimbatore and Tiruppur) decentralises the planning approvals and also allows the initiation of proposals for infrastructure development for urban plan areas in line with CMDA. This paves way for approaching the lending agencies which can contribute to major development of planning area of respective authorities,” says S Sridharan, Chairman, Urban Development Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.

Speaking to TNIE, Coimbatore Corporation commissioner M Prathap said, “The Tamil Nadu government is taking necessary steps in forming a CMDA-like body in Coimbatore. The Coimbatore city will likely be getting its own ‘Coimbatore Urban Development Authority (CUDA)’ by next year. A month ago, a G.O. was issued for the formation of the body. An IAS officer will be appointed to lead the CUDA. Once established and implemented, people constructing large infrastructure with a built-up area of over 10,000 sq.ft need not visit Chennai to apply for building plan approval with the DTCP. Instead, they can get it from CUDA.”

Tiruppur Exporters and Manufacturer Association (TEAMA) President MP Muthurathinam said, “Once Tiruppur Urban Development Authority takes off, we believe, it will be a game changer. We are yet to receive communication regarding the Urban Development Area and limits which could include villages near Tiruppur city. The area’s specification could be larger than the existing Tiruppur Local Planning Area. Besides, on the state level, we want a large textile zone comprising Tiruppur, Erode, and Karur.”

CHENNAI: The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has proposed to trifurcate the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), currently spread across 1,189 sqkm, into Chennai Metropolitan Area Central encompassing core city areas and Chennai Metropolitan Area North and Chennai Metropolitan Area South.

The previous AIADMK government has planned to increase the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm making it the second largest city in the country. The new DMK government, however, has decided to rework the plan and extend the city’s metropolitan area to up to 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, a review meeting to be held under Chief Minister M K Stalin on the proposed expansion of the CMA on Tuesday has been postponed to next month, and is likely to be held after pooja holidays (October 4 and 5).

The proposed third master plan will not cover the extended areas and separate regional plans will be prepared for their development, officials said. The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm spread over Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The CMA South will extend over an area 1,809 sqkm .

‘First justify the need for expansion of CMA’

It will cover Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly) taluks. The two CMAs will have their respective regional offices. The planning wing of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning in the expanded areas may be merged with CMA Central, sources said.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering K P Subramanian said the CMDA should first justify the need for expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area. “They must institute an independent and impartial committee to decide on the issue with expert input and public consultation.

The CMDA couldn’t accomplish even certain legal obligations and a large number of projects formulated in I and II Master Plans. The expansion would only result in urban sprawls and indiscriminate conversion of fertile agricultural lands to urban development leading to environmental degradation and ecological inequilibrium,” says the former professor.

“In the above situation it’s not clear as to why the CMDA is determined to expand after aborting the master plans already in force and dissolving the existing Local Planning and the New Town Development Authorities operating in the area proposed to be expanded” he added.

Association of Professional Town Planners (APTP) president K M Sadanandh said the trifurcation won’t make any change. Chennai Metropolitan Area should analyse its own capacity and then go in for expansion. “It should assess growth potential and plan for the next 20 years as the expansion is about four and half times the original size. The focus should be on how such a large area could be administered. It should involve almost all the departments and not just a few agencies,” he said.

The new DMK government, however, has decided to rework the plan and extend the city’s metropolitan area to up to 5,904 sqkm. According to sources, a review meeting to be held under Chief Minister M K Stalin on the proposed expansion of the CMA on Tuesday has been postponed to next month, and is likely to be held after pooja holidays (October 4 and 5).googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-8052921-2'); }); The proposed third master plan will not cover the extended areas and separate regional plans will be prepared for their development, officials said. The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm spread over Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The CMA South will extend over an area 1,809 sqkm . ‘First justify the need for expansion of CMA’ It will cover Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly) taluks. The two CMAs will have their respective regional offices. The planning wing of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning in the expanded areas may be merged with CMA Central, sources said. Former Anna University professor of urban engineering K P Subramanian said the CMDA should first justify the need for expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area. “They must institute an independent and impartial committee to decide on the issue with expert input and public consultation. The CMDA couldn’t accomplish even certain legal obligations and a large number of projects formulated in I and II Master Plans. The expansion would only result in urban sprawls and indiscriminate conversion of fertile agricultural lands to urban development leading to environmental degradation and ecological inequilibrium,” says the former professor. “In the above situation it’s not clear as to why the CMDA is determined to expand after aborting the master plans already in force and dissolving the existing Local Planning and the New Town Development Authorities operating in the area proposed to be expanded” he added. Association of Professional Town Planners (APTP) president K M Sadanandh said the trifurcation won’t make any change. Chennai Metropolitan Area should analyse its own capacity and then go in for expansion. “It should assess growth potential and plan for the next 20 years as the expansion is about four and half times the original size. The focus should be on how such a large area could be administered. It should involve almost all the departments and not just a few agencies,” he said.

CHENNAI: Chief Minister M K Stalin on Tuesday reviewed the CMDA’s proposal to expand the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) which has been pending for a long time.

The previous AIADMK government wanted to expand the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm. While the expansion of Chennai Metropolitan Area as envisaged under the earlier plan would have made the city the second largest in the country, the new plan proposes the CMA to cover an area of 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, CMDA has suggested trifurcation of the metropolitan area, with the existing CMA being known as CMA Central and expanded areas being called CMA North and CMA South. The expanded areas would be covered under regional plans and not master plan, official sources said.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm including Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The South CMA will consist of 1,809 sqkm spread across seven taluks of Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly).

CMDA member-secretary Anshul Mishra was not present during the meeting on Tuesday. Municipal Administration Minister K N Nehru, Housing and Urban Development Minister S Muthuswami, Tamil Nadu Minister for Rural Development K R Periakaruppan, Chief Secretary Irai Anbu, Municipal Administration and Water Supply Secretary Shiv Das Meena, Greater Chennai Municipal Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department Secretary P Amudha and Housing Secretary Hitesh Kumar Makwana took part in the meeting.

Residents in 28 Assembly constituencies of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), covering 1,189 sq.km, will start consultations with officials for the preparation of a vision document for the Third Master Plan 2027-2046.

As the expansion of the metropolitan planning area is expected to be notified shortly, a regional planning approach will be adopted in the expanded areas of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) and likely to be integrated with the Third Master Plan. Currently, the Master Plan efforts are focused on the existing CMA.

Housing and Urban Development Minister S. Muthusamy on Monday launched the process of stakeholder engagement for the preparation of the vision document. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) on Monday also launched a workshop and consultation to solicit the views of various stakeholders in the city.

Stakeholders, including residents, have been requested to give their views online at http://cmavision.in . The information will help the CMDA understand citizen perceptions on the future vision for the CMA. Residents will also be permitted to give suggestions to officials during the public consultations.

Launching the portal, Mr. Muthusamy said the officials of the CMDA would visit every village in the metropolitan area to get suggestions from residents. “Public consultation is very important. Residents will be able to give innovative ideas about urban planning,” the Minister said.

Pointing to the need for widening of arterial roads, such as Anna Salai, he said the master plan would facilitate planned urban development in newly-developing areas and prevent the need for frequent widening of roads in the future. Stressing the need for urban development of villages, Mr. Muthusamy said, “We are also planning to implement land pooling for development of villages along 62 km of Outer Ring Road.”

Speaking about redevelopment, Mr. Muthusamy said the Chief Minister had directed officers to redevelop old projects of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). “Many TNHB houses that were constructed more than 30 years ago are dilapidated,” he said.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Hitesh Kumar Makwana said the work to prepare the Third Master Plan, a statutory document, would start this year. “Amendment of rules will be done to add items that were not in the rules, such as GIS and coastal zone management. We will notify the rules in April, and the plan will be notified between December 2025 and April 2026,” he said. “Master plans for other areas, such as Hosur, have been prepared. Coimbatore is ready. Over 20 master plans will be prepared in the State,” he added.

The Third Master Plan will be prepared only for 1,189 sq.km. The boundary expansion of the CMA will be notified shortly. But the expanded area will only have regional planning, said Mr. Makwana.

CMDA Member Secretary Anshul Mishra stressed the need for sustainable development and economically vibrant, inclusive and climate-resilient planning in the CMA. The CMDA has planned to formulate a holistic, integrated master plan.

In pursuit of change, the CMDA would focus on transit-oriented development, land pooling and redevelopment, grid of roads, form-based codes, climate-resilient planning, tourism and waterfront development and heritage conservation, he said. CMDA would listen to the needs of residents and the long term plans of line agencies before the formulation of the Third Master Plan, Mr. Mishra said.

CMDA has started studies on land value and density distribution, review of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, strategic institutional strengthening assessment and action plan for the CMDA, factual distribution of employment and income category and agglomeration economics, integrated blue green infrastructure and urban heat island effect ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan, he said.

“We have assessed the best practices in the vision statements of cities such as Singapore, Bangkok, Manchester, Sydney and Seoul,” Mr. Mishra said.

Revenue Secretary Kumar Jayant said the consultation should involve other departments ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan.

Representatives from the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disability and local bodies participated and gave suggestions, including economic development of native population, heritage tourism, solid waste management, women safety and priority for accessibility in every segment. The visioning process for the Third Master Plan included analysis of economic development, housing growth, traffic and transportation, infrastructure, safety and security, resilience, heritage and technology with gender equality as the central aspect.

CHENNAI: Tucked away almost 60km away from the Chennai International Airport lies Parandur, the site for Chennai's second airport that is devoid of any major infrastructure or connectivity. But the site, which was in competition with Pannur, was selected due to its closeness to Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway.

"Parandur was selected as it was only 7km to 8km away from the upcoming Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway, for which the work is underway. The 262-km-long, six-lane, access-controlled expressway, which begins at Hoskote in Karnataka and ends at Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Chennai could play a major role in the connectivity to the airport," official sources said.

Another major connectivity to the second airport is likely to be the Chennai Metro Rail. The government has recently announced plans to extend Corridor-4, which is from Light House to Poonamallee Bypass to Sriperumbudur. A feasibility study is going to be conducted.

Official sources told TNIE that it was likely that the metro rail connectivity could be extended to Parandur. While the project is likely to take another 10 years to get implemented, the city is likely to expand beyond ORR with the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) planning to open up the land parcels in and around ORR.

A report prepared for the CMDA has suggested large-scale housing, industrial and commercial developments. Official sources said the study was undertaken by keeping in mind that the transit-oriented development concepts across key corridors like in Delhi and Ahmedabad and international models like that of Curitiba, the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Paraná, and Portland, the largest and most populous city in the US state of Oregon.

According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association (CREDAI), the second airport will give a big push to the aviation sector in Parandur. "It's paramount that connectivity to the airport is well planned and executed in the models of international cities. This should give a fillip to the setting up of ancillary and support industries in the corridor," CREDAI stated. Interestingly, the site is located closer to various industrial parks in Sriperumbudur. This includes the aerospace park.

Air quality of Chennai deteriorates on Deepavali

On the day of Deepavali, Chennai saw skyrocketing levels of air pollution. Pic: Wikimedia Commons

Air quality in Chennai on this Deepavali was worse than the city’s lowest on record in 2020. As recorded by the TNPCB’s air quality monitors, AQI (Air Quality Index) oscillated between “poor” and “severe” ranges of 345 and 786. This increased the risk of respiratory illnesses in Chennai.

Besant Nagar had an AQI of 345, which was “poor” and Sowcarpet’s AQI was 786, which fell in the “severe” category. According to experts, the severe AQI level in Sowcarpet is equivalent to a person smoking 31 cigarettes in one day.

During Deepavali, PM 2.5, the most dangerous particulate matter in the air in Chennai, reached a level of 500 units on October 25th, while the recommended PM 2.5 level is 60 units.

Excessive bursting of fireworks, high relative humidity and low wind speed were the main reasons for high pollution levels in Chennai, explained the TNPCB authorities. In other words, smoke from the crackers did not escape easily due to the climatic conditions.

Buckingham Canal soon to be free of sewage: Metrowater

After clearing encroachments, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) will stop sewage water from flowing into the Buckingham Canal.

In the wake of sewage leaking into the waters of Cooum, Adyar and Buckingham Canal, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the water department about the mitigation efforts in keeping the water sources clean.

Across Cooum, Metrowater has taken up diversion and interception in 10 places. To stop sewage illegally flowing into the Adyar river, Rs 555 crores have been allotted to the Chennai River Restoration Trust.

Metrowater has laid underground sewage connections in areas including Perungudi, Karapakkam, Ullagaram, Madhavaram and Ramapuram, among other localities in Chennai.

Fall into SWD pits proves fatal for journalist

On October 22nd, a journalist fell into a stormwater drain pit near Kasi theatre, in Jafferkhanpet. 23-year-old Muthukrishnan was returning from work when the mishap took place. Witnesses and his colleagues claimed that it took an hour for people to notice him inside the pit. Later, he was admitted to Royapettah Government Hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

The Greater Chennai Corporation issued a clarification that the SWD work in that area fell under the ambit of the Department of Highways. Residents have complained against the manner in which SWD construction is being undertaken, with a lack of barricades and rods lying open, making vast stretches of roads in the city unsafe.

CHENNAI: The State government will now come out with a new transport roadmap for the Chennai Metropolitan Area till 2048, which will synchronise with the Third Master Plan (TMP), said official sources.

This comes as the present Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) for Chennai Metropolitan Area, which was prepared during the AIADMK regime, is being reviewed by the government. The mobility plan proposed an investment plan of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which was to be finalised after the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority holds its first meeting. But now, officials say it is unlikely to happen.

The idea is that development and transport infrastructure should go together. While the third masterplan is a long exercise, sources say the comprehensive mobility plan is likely to come up in the next 18 months once the State government gives its approval.

The Comprehensive Urban Mobility Plan was prepared after the State planned to improve upon the outdated Chennai Comprehensive Transportation Study (CCTS) that was unveiled in August 2010. The CCTS focused on the mobility needs of car users, while the comprehensive mobility plan was to address the mobility needs of all people and the infrastructure required for all modes, as well as to integrate both the land use (i.e., the spatial distribution of activities) and transport systems.

Official sources told TNIE that the present CMP focussed only on Metro rail corridors and could not take into account the expansion of the city. “We are waiting for in-principle approval from the State government,” sources said. It is learnt once the file is cleared, a tender will be floated to find a consultant.

“The plan is likely for 20 years and will be an evolving one. It will be frequently updated every four or five years,” sources said. This could mean the plan will take into account the new airport and electric vehicles and the proposed satellite cities, besides the proposed expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Area, including the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, among others.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering KP Subramanian, however, questioned the decision of going in for a new comprehensive plan without implementing the existing one. “There is no reason why the plan should be aborted even without giving a fair trial of implementation, and opting for preparation of a new plan when the process to prepare for the TMP has been rolled out. The ideal approach will be to make the CMP an integral part of the TMP,” he said.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has ordered the expansion of Chennai city from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 sq km, which will include as many as 1,225 new villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet areas.

The CMDA said on Twitter that the order was issued to ensure sustainable economic development of the Chennai region.

“To promote balanced urban growth in Chennai Metropolitan Area and to conserve, protect and manage the vast number of water bodies and green areas and also to ensure sustainable economic growth in Chennai region, the government has issued an order for expansion,” said the tweet.

The Minister for Housing and Urban Development S Muthusamy made the announcement in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

Muthusamy said that villages from Thiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chengalupet and Ranipet will be added to the Chennai Metropolitan area.

According to the order released by Hitesh Kumar S Makwana, the principal secretary to the government, as many as 1,225 villages will now be a part of the Chennai Metropolitan planning area.
October 22, 2022 12:08 am | Updated 01:57 am IST - CHENNAI

The Tamil Nadu government on Friday issued a government order, notifying the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) from its present size of 1,189 sq. km. to 5,904 sq. km. by including contiguous areas from Tiruvallur, Ranipet, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts.

According to the order issued by Hitesh Kumar S. Makwana, Principal Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department, a total of 1,225 villages from these four districts have been added to CMPA.

They include 550 villages from the Ponneri, Gummidipoondi, Uthukottai, Tiruvallur, Tiruttani, Poonamallee taluks of Tiruvallur district; 44 villages from the Arakkonam taluk of Ranipet district; 335 villages from the Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Sriperumbudur and Kundrathur taluks of Kancheepuram district; and 296 villages from the Chengalpattu, Thiruporur, Tirukalukundram and Vandalur taluks of Chengalpattu district.

Ran into delays

The initiative began during the previous AIADMK government in 2018, but ran into delays. The processes, including the hearing of objections or suggestions from those in the areas proposed to be included, were expedited in the recent months. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin gave the final approval to the proposal at a meeting held this month.

Although it was originally envisaged to expand CMPA to around 8,800 sq. km., the areas has been reduced to 5,904 sq. km.

Official sources said the expansion would make CMPA comparable in size to the metropolitan planning areas of some of the other top cities in the country. Until now, Chennai was the smallest, compared with a few top cities in India.

With the order issued, the changes in the administrative set-up to effect the change will soon follow, sources added.

Anshul Mishra, Member-Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, said the expansion would help in a more balanced and well-planned growth of the region.

Better planning

He said it would facilitate better planning in terms of transport and resource management and help in the protection of water sources and green cover.

It would also help in better integration of nearby town centres with the city.

CHENNAI: After 10 years of deliberations over the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA), the State government on Friday issued a Government Order (GO) specifying the inclusion of more than 1,000 villages in Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Ranipet districts into the CMA.

The GO, which was issued on Friday, however, did not specify how many km will be expanded. It merely said that a proposal by the CMDA member secretary for expansion of CMA, for inclusion of contiguous area under Clause 23-a of Section -II of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, has been accepted.

This comes after Chief Minister MK Stalin reviewed the proposal earlier this month to expand CMA from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 km. Under that, the expanded areas were to be covered under regional plans and not the master plan. It is learnt that CMDA has suggested dividing the entire CMA into three. The existing Chennai Metropolitan Area could be termed as CMA Central and the proposed expanded areas as CMA North and CMA South.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight talukas, covering a distance of 2,908 sq km. These include Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. Similarly, the South CMA will have 1,809 sq km and it will include seven talukas - Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly). While the existing Chennai Metropolitan Area of 1,189 sq km will be considered CMA Central.

Hyderabad Metropolitan Region, which was formed by combining four districts of Rangareddy, Mahboobnagar, Nalgonda and Medak has the largest area of 7,222 sq km under its jurisdiction. With the proposed expansion to 5,904km, Chennai would be the second largest city followed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority which has an area of 4,355 sq km.

S Sridharan, Chairman of the Urban Development/Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI National) said with the expansion of CMA infrastructure funding will become easier. He also said it will result in organised growth.

CHENNAI: he year 2022 has seen Chennai’s metropolitan area expanding by five times on paper, and its implications on the ground are likely to be seen in 2023. With a total of 5,904 sq kilometres under the ambit of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), growth in the capital city’s surrounding regions might become more planned.

Similarly, the state government is expected to execute its plans to create an urban planning body exclusively for Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Hosur and Madurai. In the new year, these initiatives might largely shape the urban development in the four major urban clusters.

Besides the expansion of city limits, some of the other major projects that could help in Chennai’s growth are the five proposed satellite towns, the development of land around the Outer Ring Road, and the extension of metro rail to Sholinganallur.

Other projects, including the double-decker highway from Chennai Port to Maduravoyal and the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, are also on the anvil. However, experts warn that the expansion of the cities and its suburbs may adversely impact the environment. Former Anna University professor of Urban Engineering, KP Subramanian, said the city expansion will result in loss of biodiversity, forest cover, and waterbodies.

Aarthi Lakshminarayanan of the consulting firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, explained if the surrounding regions are developed, there would be a lesser influx of people to the city’s core. “The expansion of the city limits may lead to uniform growth in the regions surrounding the cities. This will help reduce the stress on the core city’s infrastructure and resources. It also makes way for better investment and uniform distribution opportunities both in the core city and the surrounding areas,” she pointed out.

A Shankar, Chief Operating Officer, Strategic Consulting and Valuation, JLL West Asia, a property consulting firm, said the expansion would succeed if the new areas are provided with growth corridors, and rail and road connectivity. “The formation of the new urban planning authorities (in Coimbatore and Tiruppur) decentralises the planning approvals and also allows the initiation of proposals for infrastructure development for urban plan areas in line with CMDA. This paves way for approaching the lending agencies which can contribute to major development of planning area of respective authorities,” says S Sridharan, Chairman, Urban Development Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.

Speaking to TNIE, Coimbatore Corporation commissioner M Prathap said, “The Tamil Nadu government is taking necessary steps in forming a CMDA-like body in Coimbatore. The Coimbatore city will likely be getting its own ‘Coimbatore Urban Development Authority (CUDA)’ by next year. A month ago, a G.O. was issued for the formation of the body. An IAS officer will be appointed to lead the CUDA. Once established and implemented, people constructing large infrastructure with a built-up area of over 10,000 sq.ft need not visit Chennai to apply for building plan approval with the DTCP. Instead, they can get it from CUDA.”

Tiruppur Exporters and Manufacturer Association (TEAMA) President MP Muthurathinam said, “Once Tiruppur Urban Development Authority takes off, we believe, it will be a game changer. We are yet to receive communication regarding the Urban Development Area and limits which could include villages near Tiruppur city. The area’s specification could be larger than the existing Tiruppur Local Planning Area. Besides, on the state level, we want a large textile zone comprising Tiruppur, Erode, and Karur.”

CHENNAI: he year 2022 has seen Chennai’s metropolitan area expanding by five times on paper, and its implications on the ground are likely to be seen in 2023. With a total of 5,904 sq kilometres under the ambit of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), growth in the capital city’s surrounding regions might become more planned. Similarly, the state government is expected to execute its plans to create an urban planning body exclusively for Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Hosur and Madurai. In the new year, these initiatives might largely shape the urban development in the four major urban clusters. Besides the expansion of city limits, some of the other major projects that could help in Chennai’s growth are the five proposed satellite towns, the development of land around the Outer Ring Road, and the extension of metro rail to Sholinganallur. googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-8052921-2'); }); Other projects, including the double-decker highway from Chennai Port to Maduravoyal and the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, are also on the anvil. However, experts warn that the expansion of the cities and its suburbs may adversely impact the environment. Former Anna University professor of Urban Engineering, KP Subramanian, said the city expansion will result in loss of biodiversity, forest cover, and waterbodies. Aarthi Lakshminarayanan of the consulting firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, explained if the surrounding regions are developed, there would be a lesser influx of people to the city’s core. “The expansion of the city limits may lead to uniform growth in the regions surrounding the cities. This will help reduce the stress on the core city’s infrastructure and resources. It also makes way for better investment and uniform distribution opportunities both in the core city and the surrounding areas,” she pointed out. A Shankar, Chief Operating Officer, Strategic Consulting and Valuation, JLL West Asia, a property consulting firm, said the expansion would succeed if the new areas are provided with growth corridors, and rail and road connectivity. “The formation of the new urban planning authorities (in Coimbatore and Tiruppur) decentralises the planning approvals and also allows the initiation of proposals for infrastructure development for urban plan areas in line with CMDA.

CHENNAI: The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has proposed to trifurcate the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), currently spread across 1,189 sqkm, into Chennai Metropolitan Area Central encompassing core city areas and Chennai Metropolitan Area North and Chennai Metropolitan Area South.

The previous AIADMK government has planned to increase the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm making it the second largest city in the country. The new DMK government, however, has decided to rework the plan and extend the city’s metropolitan area to up to 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, a review meeting to be held under Chief Minister M K Stalin on the proposed expansion of the CMA on Tuesday has been postponed to next month, and is likely to be held after pooja holidays (October 4 and 5).

The proposed third master plan will not cover the extended areas and separate regional plans will be prepared for their development, officials said. The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm spread over Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The CMA South will extend over an area 1,809 sqkm .

‘First justify the need for expansion of CMA’

It will cover Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly) taluks. The two CMAs will have their respective regional offices. The planning wing of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning in the expanded areas may be merged with CMA Central, sources said.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering K P Subramanian said the CMDA should first justify the need for expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area. “They must institute an independent and impartial committee to decide on the issue with expert input and public consultation.

The CMDA couldn’t accomplish even certain legal obligations and a large number of projects formulated in I and II Master Plans. The expansion would only result in urban sprawls and indiscriminate conversion of fertile agricultural lands to urban development leading to environmental degradation and ecological inequilibrium,” says the former professor.

“In the above situation it’s not clear as to why the CMDA is determined to expand after aborting the master plans already in force and dissolving the existing Local Planning and the New Town Development Authorities operating in the area proposed to be expanded” he added.

Association of Professional Town Planners (APTP) president K M Sadanandh said the trifurcation won’t make any change. Chennai Metropolitan Area should analyse its own capacity and then go in for expansion. “It should assess growth potential and plan for the next 20 years as the expansion is about four and half times the original size. The focus should be on how such a large area could be administered. It should involve almost all the departments and not just a few agencies,” he said.

CHENNAI: Chief Minister M K Stalin on Tuesday reviewed the CMDA’s proposal to expand the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) which has been pending for a long time.

The previous AIADMK government wanted to expand the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm. While the expansion of Chennai Metropolitan Area as envisaged under the earlier plan would have made the city the second largest in the country, the new plan proposes the CMA to cover an area of 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, CMDA has suggested trifurcation of the metropolitan area, with the existing CMA being known as CMA Central and expanded areas being called CMA North and CMA South. The expanded areas would be covered under regional plans and not master plan, official sources said.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm including Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The South CMA will consist of 1,809 sqkm spread across seven taluks of Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly).

CMDA member-secretary Anshul Mishra was not present during the meeting on Tuesday. Municipal Administration Minister K N Nehru, Housing and Urban Development Minister S Muthuswami, Tamil Nadu Minister for Rural Development K R Periakaruppan, Chief Secretary Irai Anbu, Municipal Administration and Water Supply Secretary Shiv Das Meena, Greater Chennai Municipal Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department Secretary P Amudha and Housing Secretary Hitesh Kumar Makwana took part in the meeting.

Residents in 28 Assembly constituencies of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), covering 1,189 sq.km, will start consultations with officials for the preparation of a vision document for the Third Master Plan 2027-2046.

As the expansion of the metropolitan planning area is expected to be notified shortly, a regional planning approach will be adopted in the expanded areas of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) and likely to be integrated with the Third Master Plan. Currently, the Master Plan efforts are focused on the existing CMA.

Housing and Urban Development Minister S. Muthusamy on Monday launched the process of stakeholder engagement for the preparation of the vision document. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) on Monday also launched a workshop and consultation to solicit the views of various stakeholders in the city.

Stakeholders, including residents, have been requested to give their views online at http://cmavision.in . The information will help the CMDA understand citizen perceptions on the future vision for the CMA. Residents will also be permitted to give suggestions to officials during the public consultations.

Launching the portal, Mr. Muthusamy said the officials of the CMDA would visit every village in the metropolitan area to get suggestions from residents. “Public consultation is very important. Residents will be able to give innovative ideas about urban planning,” the Minister said.

Pointing to the need for widening of arterial roads, such as Anna Salai, he said the master plan would facilitate planned urban development in newly-developing areas and prevent the need for frequent widening of roads in the future. Stressing the need for urban development of villages, Mr. Muthusamy said, “We are also planning to implement land pooling for development of villages along 62 km of Outer Ring Road.”

Speaking about redevelopment, Mr. Muthusamy said the Chief Minister had directed officers to redevelop old projects of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). “Many TNHB houses that were constructed more than 30 years ago are dilapidated,” he said.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Hitesh Kumar Makwana said the work to prepare the Third Master Plan, a statutory document, would start this year. “Amendment of rules will be done to add items that were not in the rules, such as GIS and coastal zone management. We will notify the rules in April, and the plan will be notified between December 2025 and April 2026,” he said. “Master plans for other areas, such as Hosur, have been prepared. Coimbatore is ready. Over 20 master plans will be prepared in the State,” he added.

The Third Master Plan will be prepared only for 1,189 sq.km. The boundary expansion of the CMA will be notified shortly. But the expanded area will only have regional planning, said Mr. Makwana.

CMDA Member Secretary Anshul Mishra stressed the need for sustainable development and economically vibrant, inclusive and climate-resilient planning in the CMA. The CMDA has planned to formulate a holistic, integrated master plan.

In pursuit of change, the CMDA would focus on transit-oriented development, land pooling and redevelopment, grid of roads, form-based codes, climate-resilient planning, tourism and waterfront development and heritage conservation, he said. CMDA would listen to the needs of residents and the long term plans of line agencies before the formulation of the Third Master Plan, Mr. Mishra said.

CMDA has started studies on land value and density distribution, review of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, strategic institutional strengthening assessment and action plan for the CMDA, factual distribution of employment and income category and agglomeration economics, integrated blue green infrastructure and urban heat island effect ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan, he said.

“We have assessed the best practices in the vision statements of cities such as Singapore, Bangkok, Manchester, Sydney and Seoul,” Mr. Mishra said.

Revenue Secretary Kumar Jayant said the consultation should involve other departments ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan.

Representatives from the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disability and local bodies participated and gave suggestions, including economic development of native population, heritage tourism, solid waste management, women safety and priority for accessibility in every segment. The visioning process for the Third Master Plan included analysis of economic development, housing growth, traffic and transportation, infrastructure, safety and security, resilience, heritage and technology with gender equality as the central aspect.

CHENNAI: Tucked away almost 60km away from the Chennai International Airport lies Parandur, the site for Chennai's second airport that is devoid of any major infrastructure or connectivity. But the site, which was in competition with Pannur, was selected due to its closeness to Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway.

"Parandur was selected as it was only 7km to 8km away from the upcoming Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway, for which the work is underway. The 262-km-long, six-lane, access-controlled expressway, which begins at Hoskote in Karnataka and ends at Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Chennai could play a major role in the connectivity to the airport," official sources said.

Another major connectivity to the second airport is likely to be the Chennai Metro Rail. The government has recently announced plans to extend Corridor-4, which is from Light House to Poonamallee Bypass to Sriperumbudur. A feasibility study is going to be conducted.

Official sources told TNIE that it was likely that the metro rail connectivity could be extended to Parandur. While the project is likely to take another 10 years to get implemented, the city is likely to expand beyond ORR with the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) planning to open up the land parcels in and around ORR.

A report prepared for the CMDA has suggested large-scale housing, industrial and commercial developments. Official sources said the study was undertaken by keeping in mind that the transit-oriented development concepts across key corridors like in Delhi and Ahmedabad and international models like that of Curitiba, the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Paraná, and Portland, the largest and most populous city in the US state of Oregon.

According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association (CREDAI), the second airport will give a big push to the aviation sector in Parandur. "It's paramount that connectivity to the airport is well planned and executed in the models of international cities. This should give a fillip to the setting up of ancillary and support industries in the corridor," CREDAI stated. Interestingly, the site is located closer to various industrial parks in Sriperumbudur. This includes the aerospace park.

Air quality of Chennai deteriorates on Deepavali

On the day of Deepavali, Chennai saw skyrocketing levels of air pollution. Pic: Wikimedia Commons

Air quality in Chennai on this Deepavali was worse than the city’s lowest on record in 2020. As recorded by the TNPCB’s air quality monitors, AQI (Air Quality Index) oscillated between “poor” and “severe” ranges of 345 and 786. This increased the risk of respiratory illnesses in Chennai.

Besant Nagar had an AQI of 345, which was “poor” and Sowcarpet’s AQI was 786, which fell in the “severe” category. According to experts, the severe AQI level in Sowcarpet is equivalent to a person smoking 31 cigarettes in one day.

During Deepavali, PM 2.5, the most dangerous particulate matter in the air in Chennai, reached a level of 500 units on October 25th, while the recommended PM 2.5 level is 60 units.

Excessive bursting of fireworks, high relative humidity and low wind speed were the main reasons for high pollution levels in Chennai, explained the TNPCB authorities. In other words, smoke from the crackers did not escape easily due to the climatic conditions.

Buckingham Canal soon to be free of sewage: Metrowater

After clearing encroachments, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) will stop sewage water from flowing into the Buckingham Canal.

In the wake of sewage leaking into the waters of Cooum, Adyar and Buckingham Canal, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the water department about the mitigation efforts in keeping the water sources clean.

Across Cooum, Metrowater has taken up diversion and interception in 10 places. To stop sewage illegally flowing into the Adyar river, Rs 555 crores have been allotted to the Chennai River Restoration Trust.

Metrowater has laid underground sewage connections in areas including Perungudi, Karapakkam, Ullagaram, Madhavaram and Ramapuram, among other localities in Chennai.

Fall into SWD pits proves fatal for journalist

On October 22nd, a journalist fell into a stormwater drain pit near Kasi theatre, in Jafferkhanpet. 23-year-old Muthukrishnan was returning from work when the mishap took place. Witnesses and his colleagues claimed that it took an hour for people to notice him inside the pit. Later, he was admitted to Royapettah Government Hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

The Greater Chennai Corporation issued a clarification that the SWD work in that area fell under the ambit of the Department of Highways. Residents have complained against the manner in which SWD construction is being undertaken, with a lack of barricades and rods lying open, making vast stretches of roads in the city unsafe.

CHENNAI: The State government will now come out with a new transport roadmap for the Chennai Metropolitan Area till 2048, which will synchronise with the Third Master Plan (TMP), said official sources.

This comes as the present Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) for Chennai Metropolitan Area, which was prepared during the AIADMK regime, is being reviewed by the government. The mobility plan proposed an investment plan of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which was to be finalised after the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority holds its first meeting. But now, officials say it is unlikely to happen.

The idea is that development and transport infrastructure should go together. While the third masterplan is a long exercise, sources say the comprehensive mobility plan is likely to come up in the next 18 months once the State government gives its approval.

The Comprehensive Urban Mobility Plan was prepared after the State planned to improve upon the outdated Chennai Comprehensive Transportation Study (CCTS) that was unveiled in August 2010. The CCTS focused on the mobility needs of car users, while the comprehensive mobility plan was to address the mobility needs of all people and the infrastructure required for all modes, as well as to integrate both the land use (i.e., the spatial distribution of activities) and transport systems.

Official sources told TNIE that the present CMP focussed only on Metro rail corridors and could not take into account the expansion of the city. “We are waiting for in-principle approval from the State government,” sources said. It is learnt once the file is cleared, a tender will be floated to find a consultant.

“The plan is likely for 20 years and will be an evolving one. It will be frequently updated every four or five years,” sources said. This could mean the plan will take into account the new airport and electric vehicles and the proposed satellite cities, besides the proposed expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Area, including the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, among others.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering KP Subramanian, however, questioned the decision of going in for a new comprehensive plan without implementing the existing one. “There is no reason why the plan should be aborted even without giving a fair trial of implementation, and opting for preparation of a new plan when the process to prepare for the TMP has been rolled out. The ideal approach will be to make the CMP an integral part of the TMP,” he said.

Ran into delays

The initiative began during the previous AIADMK government in 2018, but ran into delays. The processes, including the hearing of objections or suggestions from those in the areas proposed to be included, were expedited in the recent months. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin gave the final approval to the proposal at a meeting held this month.

Although it was originally envisaged to expand CMPA to around 8,800 sq. km., the areas has been reduced to 5,904 sq. km.

Official sources said the expansion would make CMPA comparable in size to the metropolitan planning areas of some of the other top cities in the country. Until now, Chennai was the smallest, compared with a few top cities in India.

With the order issued, the changes in the administrative set-up to effect the change will soon follow, sources added.

Anshul Mishra, Member-Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, said the expansion would help in a more balanced and well-planned growth of the region.

Better planning

He said it would facilitate better planning in terms of transport and resource management and help in the protection of water sources and green cover.

It would also help in better integration of nearby town centres with the city.

CHENNAI: After 10 years of deliberations over the expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA), the State government on Friday issued a Government Order (GO) specifying the inclusion of more than 1,000 villages in Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Ranipet districts into the CMA.

The GO, which was issued on Friday, however, did not specify how many km will be expanded. It merely said that a proposal by the CMDA member secretary for expansion of CMA, for inclusion of contiguous area under Clause 23-a of Section -II of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, has been accepted.

This comes after Chief Minister MK Stalin reviewed the proposal earlier this month to expand CMA from 1,189 sq km to 5,904 km. Under that, the expanded areas were to be covered under regional plans and not the master plan. It is learnt that CMDA has suggested dividing the entire CMA into three. The existing Chennai Metropolitan Area could be termed as CMA Central and the proposed expanded areas as CMA North and CMA South.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight talukas, covering a distance of 2,908 sq km. These include Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. Similarly, the South CMA will have 1,809 sq km and it will include seven talukas - Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly). While the existing Chennai Metropolitan Area of 1,189 sq km will be considered CMA Central.

Hyderabad Metropolitan Region, which was formed by combining four districts of Rangareddy, Mahboobnagar, Nalgonda and Medak has the largest area of 7,222 sq km under its jurisdiction. With the proposed expansion to 5,904km, Chennai would be the second largest city followed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority which has an area of 4,355 sq km.

S Sridharan, Chairman of the Urban Development/Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI National) said with the expansion of CMA infrastructure funding will become easier. He also said it will result in organised growth.

CHENNAI: he year 2022 has seen Chennai’s metropolitan area expanding by five times on paper, and its implications on the ground are likely to be seen in 2023. With a total of 5,904 sq kilometres under the ambit of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), growth in the capital city’s surrounding regions might become more planned.

Similarly, the state government is expected to execute its plans to create an urban planning body exclusively for Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Hosur and Madurai. In the new year, these initiatives might largely shape the urban development in the four major urban clusters.

Besides the expansion of city limits, some of the other major projects that could help in Chennai’s growth are the five proposed satellite towns, the development of land around the Outer Ring Road, and the extension of metro rail to Sholinganallur.

Other projects, including the double-decker highway from Chennai Port to Maduravoyal and the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, are also on the anvil. However, experts warn that the expansion of the cities and its suburbs may adversely impact the environment. Former Anna University professor of Urban Engineering, KP Subramanian, said the city expansion will result in loss of biodiversity, forest cover, and waterbodies.

Aarthi Lakshminarayanan of the consulting firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, explained if the surrounding regions are developed, there would be a lesser influx of people to the city’s core. “The expansion of the city limits may lead to uniform growth in the regions surrounding the cities. This will help reduce the stress on the core city’s infrastructure and resources. It also makes way for better investment and uniform distribution opportunities both in the core city and the surrounding areas,” she pointed out.

A Shankar, Chief Operating Officer, Strategic Consulting and Valuation, JLL West Asia, a property consulting firm, said the expansion would succeed if the new areas are provided with growth corridors, and rail and road connectivity. “The formation of the new urban planning authorities (in Coimbatore and Tiruppur) decentralises the planning approvals and also allows the initiation of proposals for infrastructure development for urban plan areas in line with CMDA. This paves way for approaching the lending agencies which can contribute to major development of planning area of respective authorities,” says S Sridharan, Chairman, Urban Development Affordable Housing Committee, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India.

Speaking to TNIE, Coimbatore Corporation commissioner M Prathap said, “The Tamil Nadu government is taking necessary steps in forming a CMDA-like body in Coimbatore. The Coimbatore city will likely be getting its own ‘Coimbatore Urban Development Authority (CUDA)’ by next year. A month ago, a G.O. was issued for the formation of the body. An IAS officer will be appointed to lead the CUDA. Once established and implemented, people constructing large infrastructure with a built-up area of over 10,000 sq.ft need not visit Chennai to apply for building plan approval with the DTCP. Instead, they can get it from CUDA.”

Tiruppur Exporters and Manufacturer Association (TEAMA) President MP Muthurathinam said, “Once Tiruppur Urban Development Authority takes off, we believe, it will be a game changer. We are yet to receive communication regarding the Urban Development Area and limits which could include villages near Tiruppur city. The area’s specification could be larger than the existing Tiruppur Local Planning Area. Besides, on the state level, we want a large textile zone comprising Tiruppur, Erode, and Karur.”

CHENNAI: The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has proposed to trifurcate the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), currently spread across 1,189 sqkm, into Chennai Metropolitan Area Central encompassing core city areas and Chennai Metropolitan Area North and Chennai Metropolitan Area South.

The previous AIADMK government has planned to increase the CMA from 1,189 sqkm to 8,878 sqkm making it the second largest city in the country. The new DMK government, however, has decided to rework the plan and extend the city’s metropolitan area to up to 5,904 sqkm.

According to sources, a review meeting to be held under Chief Minister M K Stalin on the proposed expansion of the CMA on Tuesday has been postponed to next month, and is likely to be held after pooja holidays (October 4 and 5).

The proposed third master plan will not cover the extended areas and separate regional plans will be prepared for their development, officials said. The Chennai Metropolitan Area North will consist of eight taluks covering an area of 2,908 sqkm spread over Gummidipoondi, Ponneri, Uthukottai, Tirutanni (partly), Arakonnam (partly), Thiruvallur, Poonamallee (partly) and Sriperumbudur. The CMA South will extend over an area 1,809 sqkm .

‘First justify the need for expansion of CMA’

It will cover Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Chengalpattu, Thirukalukundram, Thiruporur, Kundrathur (partly) and Vandalur (partly) taluks. The two CMAs will have their respective regional offices. The planning wing of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning in the expanded areas may be merged with CMA Central, sources said.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering K P Subramanian said the CMDA should first justify the need for expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area. “They must institute an independent and impartial committee to decide on the issue with expert input and public consultation.

The CMDA couldn’t accomplish even certain legal obligations and a large number of projects formulated in I and II Master Plans. The expansion would only result in urban sprawls and indiscriminate conversion of fertile agricultural lands to urban development leading to environmental degradation and ecological inequilibrium,” says the former professor.

“In the above situation it’s not clear as to why the CMDA is determined to expand after aborting the master plans already in force and dissolving the existing Local Planning and the New Town Development Authorities operating in the area proposed to be expanded” he added.

Association of Professional Town Planners (APTP) president K M Sadanandh said the trifurcation won’t make any change. Chennai Metropolitan Area should analyse its own capacity and then go in for expansion. “It should assess growth potential and plan for the next 20 years as the expansion is about four and half times the original size. The focus should be on how such a large area could be administered. It should involve almost all the departments and not just a few agencies,” he said.

Residents in 28 Assembly constituencies of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), covering 1,189 sq.km, will start consultations with officials for the preparation of a vision document for the Third Master Plan 2027-2046.

As the expansion of the metropolitan planning area is expected to be notified shortly, a regional planning approach will be adopted in the expanded areas of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area (CMPA) and likely to be integrated with the Third Master Plan. Currently, the Master Plan efforts are focused on the existing CMA.

Housing and Urban Development Minister S. Muthusamy on Monday launched the process of stakeholder engagement for the preparation of the vision document. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) on Monday also launched a workshop and consultation to solicit the views of various stakeholders in the city.

Stakeholders, including residents, have been requested to give their views online at http://cmavision.in . The information will help the CMDA understand citizen perceptions on the future vision for the CMA. Residents will also be permitted to give suggestions to officials during the public consultations.

Launching the portal, Mr. Muthusamy said the officials of the CMDA would visit every village in the metropolitan area to get suggestions from residents. “Public consultation is very important. Residents will be able to give innovative ideas about urban planning,” the Minister said.

Pointing to the need for widening of arterial roads, such as Anna Salai, he said the master plan would facilitate planned urban development in newly-developing areas and prevent the need for frequent widening of roads in the future. Stressing the need for urban development of villages, Mr. Muthusamy said, “We are also planning to implement land pooling for development of villages along 62 km of Outer Ring Road.”

Speaking about redevelopment, Mr. Muthusamy said the Chief Minister had directed officers to redevelop old projects of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB). “Many TNHB houses that were constructed more than 30 years ago are dilapidated,” he said.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Hitesh Kumar Makwana said the work to prepare the Third Master Plan, a statutory document, would start this year. “Amendment of rules will be done to add items that were not in the rules, such as GIS and coastal zone management. We will notify the rules in April, and the plan will be notified between December 2025 and April 2026,” he said. “Master plans for other areas, such as Hosur, have been prepared. Coimbatore is ready. Over 20 master plans will be prepared in the State,” he added.

The Third Master Plan will be prepared only for 1,189 sq.km. The boundary expansion of the CMA will be notified shortly. But the expanded area will only have regional planning, said Mr. Makwana.

CMDA Member Secretary Anshul Mishra stressed the need for sustainable development and economically vibrant, inclusive and climate-resilient planning in the CMA. The CMDA has planned to formulate a holistic, integrated master plan.

In pursuit of change, the CMDA would focus on transit-oriented development, land pooling and redevelopment, grid of roads, form-based codes, climate-resilient planning, tourism and waterfront development and heritage conservation, he said. CMDA would listen to the needs of residents and the long term plans of line agencies before the formulation of the Third Master Plan, Mr. Mishra said.

CMDA has started studies on land value and density distribution, review of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, strategic institutional strengthening assessment and action plan for the CMDA, factual distribution of employment and income category and agglomeration economics, integrated blue green infrastructure and urban heat island effect ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan, he said.

“We have assessed the best practices in the vision statements of cities such as Singapore, Bangkok, Manchester, Sydney and Seoul,” Mr. Mishra said.

Revenue Secretary Kumar Jayant said the consultation should involve other departments ahead of the preparation of the Third Master Plan.

Representatives from the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disability and local bodies participated and gave suggestions, including economic development of native population, heritage tourism, solid waste management, women safety and priority for accessibility in every segment. The visioning process for the Third Master Plan included analysis of economic development, housing growth, traffic and transportation, infrastructure, safety and security, resilience, heritage and technology with gender equality as the central aspect.

CHENNAI: Tucked away almost 60km away from the Chennai International Airport lies Parandur, the site for Chennai's second airport that is devoid of any major infrastructure or connectivity. But the site, which was in competition with Pannur, was selected due to its closeness to Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway.

"Parandur was selected as it was only 7km to 8km away from the upcoming Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway, for which the work is underway. The 262-km-long, six-lane, access-controlled expressway, which begins at Hoskote in Karnataka and ends at Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Chennai could play a major role in the connectivity to the airport," official sources said.

Another major connectivity to the second airport is likely to be the Chennai Metro Rail. The government has recently announced plans to extend Corridor-4, which is from Light House to Poonamallee Bypass to Sriperumbudur. A feasibility study is going to be conducted.

Official sources told TNIE that it was likely that the metro rail connectivity could be extended to Parandur. While the project is likely to take another 10 years to get implemented, the city is likely to expand beyond ORR with the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) planning to open up the land parcels in and around ORR.

A report prepared for the CMDA has suggested large-scale housing, industrial and commercial developments. Official sources said the study was undertaken by keeping in mind that the transit-oriented development concepts across key corridors like in Delhi and Ahmedabad and international models like that of Curitiba, the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Paraná, and Portland, the largest and most populous city in the US state of Oregon.

According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association (CREDAI), the second airport will give a big push to the aviation sector in Parandur. "It's paramount that connectivity to the airport is well planned and executed in the models of international cities. This should give a fillip to the setting up of ancillary and support industries in the corridor," CREDAI stated. Interestingly, the site is located closer to various industrial parks in Sriperumbudur. This includes the aerospace park.

Egmore railway station to get a makeover

Under the Prime Minister’s Gati Shakti-National Master Plan for Multi-modal Connectivity, the Egmore railway station will be revamped to international standards. DEC Infrastructure and Projects is the contractor who will take up the redevelopment project. The project will take a year and a half, and will cost Rs 734 crore. The second-biggest station in Chennai will have various amenities like lounges, food courts and multi-level car parking spaces among other things. The platform of the station will also be redone.

Since the station is a heritage structure, the work will proceed after a nod from the State Heritage Committee.

Air quality of Chennai deteriorates on Deepavali

On the day of Deepavali, Chennai saw skyrocketing levels of air pollution. Pic: Wikimedia Commons

Air quality in Chennai on this Deepavali was worse than the city’s lowest on record in 2020. As recorded by the TNPCB’s air quality monitors, AQI (Air Quality Index) oscillated between “poor” and “severe” ranges of 345 and 786. This increased the risk of respiratory illnesses in Chennai.

Besant Nagar had an AQI of 345, which was “poor” and Sowcarpet’s AQI was 786, which fell in the “severe” category. According to experts, the severe AQI level in Sowcarpet is equivalent to a person smoking 31 cigarettes in one day.

During Deepavali, PM 2.5, the most dangerous particulate matter in the air in Chennai, reached a level of 500 units on October 25th, while the recommended PM 2.5 level is 60 units.

Excessive bursting of fireworks, high relative humidity and low wind speed were the main reasons for high pollution levels in Chennai, explained the TNPCB authorities. In other words, smoke from the crackers did not escape easily due to the climatic conditions.

Buckingham Canal soon to be free of sewage: Metrowater

After clearing encroachments, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) will stop sewage water from flowing into the Buckingham Canal.

In the wake of sewage leaking into the waters of Cooum, Adyar and Buckingham Canal, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the water department about the mitigation efforts in keeping the water sources clean.

Across Cooum, Metrowater has taken up diversion and interception in 10 places. To stop sewage illegally flowing into the Adyar river, Rs 555 crores have been allotted to the Chennai River Restoration Trust.

Metrowater has laid underground sewage connections in areas including Perungudi, Karapakkam, Ullagaram, Madhavaram and Ramapuram, among other localities in Chennai.

Fall into SWD pits proves fatal for journalist

On October 22nd, a journalist fell into a stormwater drain pit near Kasi theatre, in Jafferkhanpet. 23-year-old Muthukrishnan was returning from work when the mishap took place. Witnesses and his colleagues claimed that it took an hour for people to notice him inside the pit. Later, he was admitted to Royapettah Government Hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

The Greater Chennai Corporation issued a clarification that the SWD work in that area fell under the ambit of the Department of Highways. Residents have complained against the manner in which SWD construction is being undertaken, with a lack of barricades and rods lying open, making vast stretches of roads in the city unsafe.

CHENNAI: The State government will now come out with a new transport roadmap for the Chennai Metropolitan Area till 2048, which will synchronise with the Third Master Plan (TMP), said official sources.

This comes as the present Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) for Chennai Metropolitan Area, which was prepared during the AIADMK regime, is being reviewed by the government. The mobility plan proposed an investment plan of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore, which was to be finalised after the Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority holds its first meeting. But now, officials say it is unlikely to happen.

The idea is that development and transport infrastructure should go together. While the third masterplan is a long exercise, sources say the comprehensive mobility plan is likely to come up in the next 18 months once the State government gives its approval.

The Comprehensive Urban Mobility Plan was prepared after the State planned to improve upon the outdated Chennai Comprehensive Transportation Study (CCTS) that was unveiled in August 2010. The CCTS focused on the mobility needs of car users, while the comprehensive mobility plan was to address the mobility needs of all people and the infrastructure required for all modes, as well as to integrate both the land use (i.e., the spatial distribution of activities) and transport systems.

Official sources told TNIE that the present CMP focussed only on Metro rail corridors and could not take into account the expansion of the city. “We are waiting for in-principle approval from the State government,” sources said. It is learnt once the file is cleared, a tender will be floated to find a consultant.

“The plan is likely for 20 years and will be an evolving one. It will be frequently updated every four or five years,” sources said. This could mean the plan will take into account the new airport and electric vehicles and the proposed satellite cities, besides the proposed expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Area, including the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor, among others.

Former Anna University professor of urban engineering KP Subramanian, however, questioned the decision of going in for a new comprehensive plan without implementing the existing one. “There is no reason why the plan should be aborted even without giving a fair trial of implementation, and opting for preparation of a new plan when the process to prepare for the TMP has been rolled out. The ideal approach will be to make the CMP an integral part of the TMP,” he said.
