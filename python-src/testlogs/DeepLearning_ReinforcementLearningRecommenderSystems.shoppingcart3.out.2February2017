ThoughtNet based Recommender System (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential) for class -  David  : Uncertainty The Life and Science of Werner Heisenberg, by David Cassidy 1992 This life of quantum architect Werner Heisenberg captures the sweep and drama of his early years. A wunderkind who received his doctorate at 22, Heisenberg introduced his version of quantum mechanics just two years later and followed up soon after that with the famous uncertainty principle. On the heels of those triumphs, Heisenberg struggled to balance his abiding German patriotism with the realities of Nazism  a regime that tapped him to lead the still controversial German nuclear effort.
ThoughtNet based Recommender System (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential) for class -  quantum  : Mr. Tompkins in Paperback, by George Gamow 1993 Gamow was an accomplished theoretical physicist who helped invent the big-bang model of the universe. He was also an inveterate practical jokester. In 1940 he created the endearing Mr Tompkins, a bank clerk with a hankering for science. Gamows main trick was to play with the constants of nature so that Tompkins could experience its exotic effects on a human scale. Slow the speed of light, for example, and bicyclists wristwatches betray all the effects of Einsteins relativity. Increase Plancks constant, and suddenly billiard balls in a pub dissolve into interpenetrating puffs of probability. These lighthearted stories offer a taste of the curiosities of modern physics.
ThoughtNet based Recommender System (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential) for class -  quantum  :  The Age of Entanglement When Quantum Physics was Reborn, by Louisa Gilder 2008 Some of the most provocative features of quantum theory emerged much more recently. The notion of quantum entanglement which Einstein had dubbed, dismissively, as spooky action at a distance came into its own over the past 50 years. Gilder provides a creative rendering of the newer material with a series of portraits based on physicists published writings, unpublished correspondence and interviews. Her account blends popular science writing with historical detective work and narrative flair.

Though written long before the latest discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider, Crease and Mann captured the drama of physicists' long quest to tease apart the ultimate constituents and forces of nature.

The opening chapter provides an accessible, brief introduction to quantum theory and broaches several competing perspectives on how best to make sense of its implications. The interviews capture a moment in time, during the mid 1980s, when several leading physicists began to grapple again with the interpretation of quantum theory, a subject that had largely been shunted aside.

The notion of quantum entanglement which Einstein had dubbed, dismissively, as spooky action at a distance came into its own over the past 50 years. Gilder provides a creative rendering of the newer material with a series of portraits based on physicists published writings, unpublished correspondence and interviews.

Though written long before the latest discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider, Crease and Mann captured the drama of physicists' long quest to tease apart the ultimate constituents and forces of nature.

On the heels of those triumphs, Heisenberg struggled to balance his abiding German patriotism with the realities of Nazism  a regime that tapped him to lead the still controversial German nuclear effort.

ThoughtNet based Recommender System (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential) for class -  Philistine  : Uncertainty The Life and Science of Werner Heisenberg, by David Cassidy 1992 This life of quantum architect Werner Heisenberg captures the sweep and drama of his early years. A wunderkind who received his doctorate at 22, Heisenberg introduced his version of quantum mechanics just two years later and followed up soon after that with the famous uncertainty principle. On the heels of those triumphs, Heisenberg struggled to balance his abiding German patriotism with the realities of Nazism  a regime that tapped him to lead the still controversial German nuclear effort.
ThoughtNet based Recommender System (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential) for class -  text  : Robert Geroch, General relativity from A to B.  University of Chicago Press, 1981.  As the title suggests, you can't expect to master a significant fraction of the basic notions of GR in this book, but what Geroch does cover here is very well explained.  A beautifully illustrated and very gentle introduction to the geometry of Minkowski spacetime of SR and then to the curved spacetimes of GR, including a clear intuitive discussion of some features of Schwarzschild geometry (nonrotating uncharged black holes), by a leading physicist.
ThoughtNet based Recommender System (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential) for class -  solutions  : Mr. Tompkins in Paperback, by George Gamow 1993 Gamow was an accomplished theoretical physicist who helped invent the big-bang model of the universe. He was also an inveterate practical jokester. In 1940 he created the endearing Mr Tompkins, a bank clerk with a hankering for science. Gamows main trick was to play with the constants of nature so that Tompkins could experience its exotic effects on a human scale. Slow the speed of light, for example, and bicyclists wristwatches betray all the effects of Einsteins relativity. Increase Plancks constant, and suddenly billiard balls in a pub dissolve into interpenetrating puffs of probability. These lighthearted stories offer a taste of the curiosities of modern physics.
ThoughtNet based Recommender System (reward) returned(in descending order of evocation potential) for class -  solutions  :  The Age of Entanglement When Quantum Physics was Reborn, by Louisa Gilder 2008 Some of the most provocative features of quantum theory emerged much more recently. The notion of quantum entanglement which Einstein had dubbed, dismissively, as spooky action at a distance came into its own over the past 50 years. Gilder provides a creative rendering of the newer material with a series of portraits based on physicists published writings, unpublished correspondence and interviews. Her account blends popular science writing with historical detective work and narrative flair.
