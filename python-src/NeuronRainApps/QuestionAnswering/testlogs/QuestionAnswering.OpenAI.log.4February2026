I can, however, suggest safe over‑the‑counter options and when to see a clinician. (Also: antibiotics don’t help the common cold, which is usually viral.)\n\n## Symptom relief (adults, generally healthy)\nChoose based on your symptoms—don’t take everything at once.\n\n### Fever/aches/sore throat\n- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: 500–1000 mg every 6–8 hours as needed (max **3,000 mg/day** unless a clinician says otherwise).  \n- **Ibuprofen**: 200–400 mg every 6–8 hours with food (max **1,200 mg/day OTC**).  \nAvoid ibuprofen if you have stomach ulcers, kidney disease, are on blood thinners, or are pregnant (especially 3rd trimester).\n\n### Nasal congestion\n- **Pseudoephedrine** (oral decongestant): effective but can raise blood pressure and cause jitteriness/insomnia. Avoid with uncontrolled hypertension, certain heart conditions, or if taking stimulants/MAOIs. Ask the pharmacist.\n- **Oxymetazoline nasal spray**: 1–2 sprays/nostril twice daily for **no more than 3 days** (to avoid rebound congestion).\n- **Saline spray/rinse**: safe and helpful.\n\n### Runny nose/sneezing\n- **Cetirizine 10 mg daily** or **loratadine 10 mg daily** (less drowsy).  \n- **Diphenhydramine 25–50 mg** at night can help but causes drowsiness; avoid driving/alcohol.\n\n### Cough\n- **Honey** (1–2 tsp) can reduce cough (do **not** give to children <1 year).\n- **Dextromethorphan** can help some people; avoid if taking serotonergic meds (e.g., some antidepressants) unless a clinician/pharmacist confirms it’s safe.\n- **Guaifenesin** may help loosen mucus—drink plenty of fluids.\n\n## Non‑drug measures\nRest, fluids, warm tea/soup, salt‑water gargles, humidifier/steam, throat lozenges.\n\n## Seek medical care urgently if\nShortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, severe dehydration, blue lips, or symptoms rapidly worsening.\n\n## See a clinician soon if\n- Fever >3 days, or >103°F/39.4°C\n- Symptoms >10 days without improvement\n- Severe sinus pain, ear pain, or worsening after initial improvement\n- You’re pregnant, immunocompromised, have significant chronic disease, or it’s for a young child.\n\nIf you tell me **age**, **main symptoms** (congestion/cough/fever), **medical conditions**, and **current meds**, I can suggest a safer, more specific OTC regimen and dosing.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, refusal=None, annotations=[]))], created=1770202125, model='gpt-5.2-2025-12-11', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=602, prompt_tokens=13, total_tokens=615, prompt_tokens_details={'cached_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0}, completion_tokens_details={'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}), service_tier='default')
