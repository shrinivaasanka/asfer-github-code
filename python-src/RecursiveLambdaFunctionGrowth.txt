Chennai: The mega expansion would see an increase to 8,878 square kilometres from 1,189 sqkm. The decision to expand the CMA was revealed by the Housing and Urban Development Minister K Radhakrishnan in the Assembly while he moved the demand on July 3, 2017. The notification follows the proposal forwarded by the Member-Secretary, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) for expansion of CMA for inclusion of the said additional areas.  The District Collectors of Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Vellore were also directed to republish the notification in their District Gazette. The expansion will ensure equitable growth and integrated urbanisation. The initiative was to streamline development in areas around Chennai that were witnessing rapid urbanisation.  The measure would also decongest the city area, the Minister had informed the House.  A Strategic Regional Plan will be prepared for the region. It will focus on aspects like transport, basic infrastructural amenities, guarding fertile farm lands and environment protection. To fulfil the goals, necessary changes will be made to the administrative set up of Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, he added. According to Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority website, the present CMA comprises 1,189 sq km of Chennai district and parts of Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts.  The expansion plan was mooted way back in 2011. The proposal was similar to what other cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad had done, expanding their respective regions to ensure proper development.
