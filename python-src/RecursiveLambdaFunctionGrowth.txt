On 3 July 2017 the Government of Tamil Nadu's minister for housing and urban development, Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan announced its intention to expand the CMA to 8,878 km2 (3,428 sq mi). The extension will cover all of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts and Arakkonam taluk of Vellore district, as proposed in July 2012. Having completed a feasibility study, a strategic regional plan was now required, and completion of the whole process was expected by July 2018.  On 22 January 2018 the Government of Tamil Nadu issued order GO No.13 to declare the intention to include additional areas in the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area under section 2, clause 23-a of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act 1971 Tamil Nadu Act 35 of 1972.  The State Government issued a Government Order giving force to its proposal to expand the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area by adding villages from three nearby districts â€” Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Vellore.  In the GO. issued by the Housing and Urban Development department on January 22, 2018, the government has expanded the jurisdiction of the Chennai Metropolitan Planning Area.  This widening was carried out based on Demand no. 26 moved by the Housing and Urban Development Minister in the Legislative Assembly on July 3, 2017.  As part of the expansion, 1,709 villages have been added to the Chennai Metropolitan area.  From Tiruvallur district, villages of the Ponneri, Gummidipoondi, Uthukottai, Tiruvallur, Tiruttani and Pallipattu taluks have been included.  From Kancheepuram district, villages of the Kancheepuram, Walajabad, Sriperumbudur, Chengalpet, Tiruporur, Uthiramerur, Madurantakam, Thirukazhukundram, and Cheyyurtaluks have been included, while those from the Arakkonam and Nemili taluks have been added in the list from Vellore district.  The GO. also directs the Collectors of Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Vellore districts to republic the notification in their respective District Gazette.  Chief planners of the CMDA have suggested that the second option is more feasible. Another planning model, similar to the National Capital Region was also examined by the CMDA. In order to plan for balanced regional development, developing a larger road network, implementing an integrated transport plan and identifying a Chennai Mega Region have become necessary.
